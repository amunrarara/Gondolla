The material force in its totally-lifeless form, capable of bearing no Light, untouchable by Light, thus representing a Realm hidden from Beings of Light.

The force created by Miro, who coveted Mata's greatest creations, The Atma, and Admata.

ShaddƒÅh is diametrically opposed to Admata, and thus cannot bear The Atma. It is for this reason that the Anavandra have cunningly crafted The Aeon, upon which the work of Vandra would bring into being the Adani, Beings of both Light and Shadow, imbued with The Atma and capable of transforming Shaddah into Admata, which can then be brought to the center of Gondolla and complete the final Pilgrimage, transforming Admata back unto The Atma, thus returning the Light of Gondolla back until Eia.
