Just ten more minutes. I keep saying that. Stupid. I'm stupid. Stupid stupid.
I've been sitting here for twenty minutes. That stupid waiter is probably
ignoring me. I was standing over there for twenty minutes, surrounded by all
those stupid, hungry people. I'm glad I got a seat by the window. The view is
white sand beaches, palm trees tearing apart like my life. My knife is dull. Is
that a smudge on the fork? I bet the steak is going to be really bloody. Juicy.
Look at all these people pretending to have fun. I wish I could pretend to
have fun. All I have is this stupid ugly nose. I never have fun. I hope I don't
have a booger on my face. That person is staring at me. There must be a
booger on my face. I'll wipe it off when they stop staring at me. Rude. Oh,
wait. They're probably looking at somebody else. Somebody who doesn't
have an ugly nose. I'll leave soon, don't worry, asshole. Just ten more
minutes.
