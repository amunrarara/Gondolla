# The Song of The High Above

Once, long ago, in a corner of that faraway land we know as the I Magi Nation,
there dwelt a happy people, the People of the Forest, living in harmony with their
world, expressing their love of nature and receiving her bounties in return.
To the trees, they would bring nourishing water from the rivers, and the trees
would give them fruits. To the birds, they played music, with their futes and by
singing songs, and the birds would sing back to them, teaching them songs and
making music, together as one.

Their futes were made in a neighboring land, where dwelt a great Wizard who
could listen to a birdsongs and bring it magically to life within his musical
creations. His instruments made their way far and wide across I Magi Nation,
until every person, young and old, knew the songs of the birds, and harmony
between the air and the earth was maintained.

But it is known that all places in this universe are created with mighty forces, and
like our own land, the I Magi Nation is woven with the forces of Creation and
Structure, but also with the forces of Change and De-Structure, all together forming
the Great Being of Transformation within which we all dwell. Thus came a time
when the People, and the Birds, and even the forest itself, would undergo a great
change, losing something of their old beauty to becoming something far greater than
before.

The catalyst of this change began when the great and ancient mountain at the heart
of the forest, whom they called Old Smokey, was over-pressured from years upon
years of boiling heat from within, never letting go of its pent-up energy; within Old
Smokey was boiling that that union of Structure and Change which we call hot
lava. Old Smokey held this energy back for millennia, for it greatly loved
Structure, never wanting to destroy what had been made, but the time fnally came
when the mountain could not hold back the torrent of hot, bubbling lava that was
preparing to burst forth.

On that day, the earth rumbled and tumbled, and with one mighty BOOM, the
mountain blew its top right of and it few high up into the sky! Out from the
fssures of the blast came pouring years upon years of collected lava, which melted
anything that stood in its path, bringing all that it touched into its great, unrelenting
force of total de-struction.

The People who dwelt in the Forest beneath the mountain were aghast with fear for
their lives and their homes. All that they had created there, all that they had
cherished, and every part of the Forest they had loved would be broken and brought
into the lava's powerful forces. As a twisting plume of smoke rose up from the
mountain, hiding the beautiful sky with dark ash, the people of the forest went out
from their homeland, escaping the calamity that had befallen.

This event was afecting all the lives of the Forest, not only the People. The birds
too were in grave danger, for their homes were in the boughs and branches of the
trees, and mighty wildfres were spreading throughout the woods and swallowing up
all of their beloved woods. The Birds sent messengers to every corner of the Forest
and called together all of their kind in their ancient meeting place, within the trunk
of The Great Tree, and together the wisest among them discussed what to do.
The People traveled for some time below the shadows and gloom, wiping fallen ash
from their faces while seeking shelter in caves of old stone. Upon the mountain, the
lava was creating barrier walls through the rivers and streams, diverting the
courses, then drying them up with its intense heat. The People watched as the river
slowly sank, disappearing, until the riverbed was stony and dry. The very air was
drying up from the heat of the mountain. The Forest that once was overfowing
with bountiful fruits and waters was now becoming parched, dried up, burnt out,
and decaying. The People now were growing thirsty, and their fear grew steadily,
and many began to lose hope.

The birds sent out scouts in all directions, hoping to fnd parts of the Forest that
were safe and could withstand the calamity. But alas, when the scouts had
returned, they found that all the Forest was burning, and the mountain continued
to pour out long tendrils of bubbling hot lava. Soon, even The Great Tree would be
surrounded in fame. They were grieved, for their kind had lived in the Forest
since time out of memory, and they knew no home beyond it, nor believed that such
a place could truly exist; there were none among them who had ever been out from
the Forest.

One scout had returned and spoke of seeing the march of the People of the Forest,
and the Birds remembered that they were not alone in this doom. Unanimously, the
Birds decided then that they would fy to meet the People of the Forest, and unite
with them in one great march, even if it be to the ends of all the earth.

The People of the Forest sat beside the rocky riverbank, underneath the gloom of the
sky, their hearts flled with sadness. They had only a little water more, and none
had ever been so far away from their homes, and many began to lose hope. There
they sat, thinking of their doom, beneath the clouds of the gloomy sky. But just then,
in their darkest hour, a little boy brought out one of the magic bird futes, and began
to play a song. It was a song that the People played when the night was upon them,
when the children sometimes feared that the day would never come again. Those
who heard his song lifted their heads, and their shaky voices rose to meet the fute in
chorus, and they felt their sadness begin to melt away. Many openly wept with the
marriage of their grief with the joy of times long past, like the coming of springlight
in the coldest of winterfrost, and soon all the People of the Forest were dancing and
singing and playing their futes, right there among the dry stones, underneath the
darkened skies, united together with music and mirth.

At this very moment, high in the sky, the great migration of the Birds covered the
darkness above. Hearing the music below, the Birds were moved with joy, and too
began to sing their ancestral songs, and in the airs above the People of the Forest, the
birds began to dance. Together, the People and the Birds made great music, as they
had for generations before, forgetting their grief and thoughts of any doom, raising
themselves beyond the challenges of life to rejoice in their connections as living beings.
Their energetic celebration created a vortex of Harmony that remains still in that
place.

In the ecstatic heights of their dancing, some of the birds were overcome with Spirit
and few higher into the sky than any had ever gone before! Up and up and up they
went, piercing through the clouds of ash, coming out upon the other side. From that
vista they could see all across I Magi Nation, and they saw for the frst time that
their Forest and the Mountain were just a little land, a tiny little place being
covered by smoke and ash. In every direction, there there were other places for them
to go explore and settle. In the even-greater ecstasy of this discovery, out from the
birds poured a brand new song, and their dances grew wild and flled with
excitement, dazzling to behold as the sunlight glittered upon their feathers. But
most importantly, the High Flyers were overcome with joy for the knowledge that
their people could venture in any direction out from that covered land and be
rescued. Quickly, they plunged back down into the ash-covered land to tell the
others.

To the People and the Birds down below, who had not taken the journey out of the
gloom, the High Flyers now sang the song and danced the dance inspired by their
vision. But in the dried-up land, the song did not carry the same air, so to speak,
and in the darkness the dance did not look so majestic, its brilliance being most
when the sun glistens on the feathers of the dancer. There were very few of either
kindred who actually believed the words of the song, most of them thinking that the
world began and ended with the Forest, and nearly all of them were unwilling to
leave the place of past safety behind. But to a few who heard the songs came hope,
and they leapt with joy at the discovery, and wanted to set out that moment to seek
new lands. The non-believers, however, shunned all hope of new life out from the
Realm of Possibility, and accepted their fate as dwellers of the ash, forever more.
The greatest grief of all was held by those High Flyers who knew truly that there
were other lands they all could venture to and be happy and free again, if only
those within the gloom could trust in such a vision.

It now fell to each of the Flyers whether they would stay here with the others who
would not leave, forsaking a life renewed to dwell among the ashes, or depart from
this forsaken land and seek a better existence. The Flyers gathered round in a
circle and sang again the song, to clearly remember the feeling of the inspiration
which birthed it forth. Those who believed but had not seen stood around them,
forming a second circle, and sang the song along with them; though it did not carry
the same brilliance of those who had been above the clouds, it gave hope that they
could see such a vision someday. Together they sang, and kindled their vision, and
became united by the hope of what lays beyond.

Then those Flyers who wished to stay, out of love for the others who chose not not
depart from the gloom, said their goodbyes to their fellow visionaries, giving them
great blessings for the journey ahead. They departed the circle, to join those who
were still dancing among the dry, lifeless rocks.

Then each of those Flyers, and the Believers who chose to begin a life renewed,
picked a direction to set out, each making their own path with the knowledge that
any way would lead them to a new life out from under the ashes.
