Violet Starlight

The oceans of Alderaan are but raindrops
in the depth of your beautiful eyes.

The music of the stars is a lullaby,
The sonnet of your voice is their song.

The thought of you is my guiding light in empty space,
That my heart may return to your violet sun,
Your love brings peace to my galaxy.

This gulf that stretches between us, so easily we can cross,
for Hyperspace is not just a lover's dream.

Fly with me to see the wondrous waterfalls of Theed,
The city built from branches on the forest world, Kashyyk,
The temples of Yavin's Moon, the little bears of Endor,
With the Force as our guide, we will see them all,

Together.

In a galaxy far, far, away,
Let's begin our journey.
