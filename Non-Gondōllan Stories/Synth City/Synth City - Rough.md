The synthwave movement seems rooted in uplift, optimism, along with the longing for spirit and a brighter tomorrow after our long, neon night. If these themes were to be encapsulated in a description of the virtual city called Synth City, what would the places in the city be? Being a place where "synth" is a material that some learn to control, that the environment is literally a "matrix", that certain experiences in the city can give the synth citizen new powers, forms, insights into the city. That beyond the city lies Void, where an expanse of synth worlds have been spun up, in all directions, where one could venture endlessly in any direction and never reach the edge of space... Ride your lightbike out from one crystal of the city to another, passing into, and out of, the Void to travel between. Giant floating crystals of Synth hanging in the Void, in clusters, each a realm unto its own. If you can get your hands on a little Synth, you can make yourself a world in the Void. Form Synth into Rooms, Objects.
