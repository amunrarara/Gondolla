The Spiritual Atom, Oneness, The Eternal Fire. A fundamental force of the universe, created by Māta in Ëia; its creation is considered the fundamental genesis of Gondōlla, since the deeds of Míro which created Shaddáh were spawned from creation of The Átma.

In the Adánic mythos, Māta created The Atma, which is a singular form of Light that has no parallel, which is the absolute force that resides within every living Being of Light; Vandra, Anavandra, and Adani. The Atma rests within the heart of every one, but is shelled by Admata which creates a separate and unique representation of each Being, capable of interaction with Gondolla. 

It is the Spiritual mission of every Adani to transform their entire Being, inner and outer, back unto The Atma, thus making the long Pilgrimage back to Eia.
