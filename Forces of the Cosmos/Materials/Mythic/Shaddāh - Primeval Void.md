The material force in its totally-lifeless form, capable of bearing no Light, untouchable by Light but able to capture it, thus representing a Realm hidden from Beings of Light.

The force created by Miro, who coveted Mata's greatest creations, the Atma and the versatile material which it sustains, *Admata*.

Shaddāh stands as a direct antithesis of Admata, its mirror match, and when the Atma moves through it, Admata and condenses Shaddah condense together to form [[Gōndë - Mingled Light and Shadow]], which bears many shapes and qualities within its self-creating domain. 

When Beings of [[Áeia]] were first lured into Shaddanic forms by Miro's sculpted promises, they did not bear the Atma within them, and thus having chosen to dwell in Miro's realm freely and openly without its protection, utterly lost their original forms, and all the Edan they are lost to Miro's complete influence Makasha, 

captured into vapors . It is for this reason that the Anavandra have cunningly crafted The Aeon, upon which the work of Vandra would bring into being the Adani, Beings of both Light and Shadow, imbued with The Atma and capable of transforming Shaddah into Admata, which can then be brought to the center of Gondolla and complete the final Pilgrimage, transforming Admata back unto The Atma, thus returning the Light of Gondolla back until Eia.
