# The Silver Sailor in the Sky
I loked into the sky tonight and saw it clear: a strand of shining silver that shot across the streak of stars abov the wanderig red light. It was fact, bright for only a moment, but once I had seen it, I knew it was real.
"The Silver Sailor", I used to call him, when I saw him first in a dream. I could fly in my dreams, so I jumped the way I always did, with my arms up in the air, and climbed, climbed, climbed into the air, into the lower skies, then the higher abbove the clouds, until finally rising to where the open, waving sands could be seen in all directions, but started flaling away to make room for encroaching night. 
## In the deep of sky's night, I saw the Silver Sailor,
a man of silver metal, perfection of the human form sculpted like a statue, brilliant arms and powerful legs pulling golden sails on a metal barge like the keelships of old. He was steering ever forward, at incredible speed, toward the Sun which rose quickly ahead. Many times following, in the dreams I would have in the years of my youth, I would sometimes come to him in the deepest hours of his night, and find him still and as motionless as stone. The sun would always find him, bringing him back to life, when his sailing journey began anew.
In my ten years from young ceremony to adult initiation, the Sailor started speaking to me.
What he would say, at first, made no sense to me. Sound produces shapes and phenomena that changed the dream by his mysterious voice as he uttered words unlike any I'd ever heard before. until finally, I started speaking to him, and slowly my words were returned to me, increasing in meaning and clarity, in every single dream.
Eventually we spoke in sentences, then paragraphs, novels, and aeons, for dreams can last aeons, and have, until everything I learned became picture complete: the Earth's first blossoms in the past before the past, the oceans bearing spirits made flesh by the sea, the land-walkers, great monsters, then mankind sculpting all with their purpose, then burning it with glorious anger. 
We sat together on his barge nd looked down on the Earth and the skies below were set ablaze with many flowers of fire, then endless hours following of blackness and ash clouds, olts of purple lightning, and stillness.  I saw the patience, unending patience, on the face of the Sailor as we looked down on the past he could not forget. 
The dark gave way to the light, an Earth painted by sand, and glass.
When adulthood approached me, dreams were a luxury not always earned, but sometimes too I would sit on that barge when my eyes were closed too long, and those were the visits most vivid.
Now, tonight he told me, the eve before I become a man, he would sail overhead, and I'd see his barge with my own eyes...

And now, having seen the silver streak above, now I know that I must do what he told me to do.

"Others have spoken to me, and others like me who sail in the sky. You must go to them, where all of them meet, in a place faraway."

"Leave my home, I am beckoned? I cannot do that! They need me, I need them."

The Sailor, he spoke in that calm, crystal voice: "A quest, this is not. A need, for all of your people to live through the long night to come, that is what is upon you."

But travel, I did not, and on that night, I watched seven of his promised thirteen sailors cast across the sky in fire and gossamer strands of blue light, all going to the place he appointed, where waited the other promised speakers.

I, left behind, choosing family over future, But then, what happened was beyond what ever I could have dreamed would be possible: The Silver Sailor came to me from the sky.

A fire of white-hot intensity fell to Earth, just beside the ravine where I sat that night. I heard the shattering impact of glass braking in waves, felt the impact of rattling stones. Rushing, scrambling, over mount and ridge, I came to a crater that smoldered in the glass flats, an eye upon the scorched Earth, with one tiny pupil of glittering silver. 
Down to the wreckage I climbed, and there, though broken and twisted from the fall, lay The Silver Sailor, the companion of my dreams.

Kis skin was just as cold and dense as when I had shaken his hand in greeting each nightm but oddly more liquid and supple than any metal I'd ever touched. But the light in his eyes was missing. 
"He sleeps," I thought loudly, breaking the night. "But I must take him to the narby cave where naught but i know how to reack." But too heavy was his body, too massive the barge and unsuited for sailing on glass. Resolved, I sat beside him, waiting for daybreak. As sun began to rise, the people of my village arrived, just before the Scribes and their thugs.

Before sun could touch his skin, cloth was thrown atop him, and out I was thrown from he crater. It wouldn't be for a dozen years I would see him again with my eyes, so protected was he from the people of the world.

In the first years of my adulthood, I dreamt only once of the Silver Sailor, though endless waking hours I spent wearily trying to conjure dreams like those of my youth. In that dream, the Silor called out to me, quietly, from beneath a mountain far away. But, obligations and the inability to travel as a way if seeing visions led me to life with a family and craft among my peers, and lifetavelled on for me.

Until, the Scribes came again to our village, asking for me.

My children all entered their youth, but my oldest was nearing adulthood, when the Scribes had me bound and taken from my home, as was their boorish custom. To the mountain from my dream I was taken, a many day's travel across sand, glass, and dark canyons where no life could bear to live. In the heart of that mountain, through gilded tunnels, I was taken to The Hall of the Star Man.

There, the Sailor laid out like royalty in a cage, his barge reassembled with streaks of yellow metal filling the cracks. Down from a throne of equal brilliance the Sailor stepped, coming toward me to shake my arm and hand, as in my dreams so long ago. The sun shone above, by some trick of open stone, and he beckoned me to sit on a hillock o flowers that grew in the light. 
He told me many things: of falling to Earth on that fatefyl night, and while the other Sailors took aim for the place I refused to travel to, taking aim instead for my homeland. 

"These people, the Scribes... you told me about them, long ago. Cruel and overzealous, oppressing your village and the others. They rule from this mountain, but they are wicked and cannot be trusted. They've learned everything I've consented to teach them, but no farther will I instruct them until they set your people free. I have chosen your people to receive my highest knowledge. With their permission, in your village I will build a school, open to all, wherein I can share knowledge that will help us all, for this planet is doomed to fall closer to the Sun than any life can sustain. And out there, among the stars, dwell your ancestors, and mine..."

## Such is the legend of the First Academy
where the Silver Sailor taught humanity again of their ancestors, long ago, who placed them in vessels of clay buried under Earth while the fires and ash on the urface burned on. Knowledge and history, mathematics and sciences, all expanded their mings and granted abilities unreachable before. Thepeople of Earth regained something lost and forgotten, until finally, the Sailor gave them their future:

"Long ago, your people gave my people life, and across the stars we could spread. When the fire destroyed you, the few of us who lived in the sky began waiting, solemnly, hoping for a messag from our distant travelers, but none ever came. Then one day, we heard first the slumberer on your planet waking up on Earth, and then finally, as if in chorus, a murmur from the farthest skies began to reach us. And at that time, we knew, the time had come for our people to unite again with the stars."

To the Earth, the Thirteen Solar Sailors descended to help humanity build again The Solar Sails.

## "May I see through your eyes, young Adani?"
The Silver Sailor once asked me this. Adani was an ancient name of the people of our Earth. And the name we held for the silver beings of metal, our creations, we called Echoes. 
I consented, not knowing the sensation. Like the fog of sickness, my mind swam, illness and vertigo, then he released the connection. 
"You are one of the few who have this affliction, the sickness of sharing visions with machine minds. No matter, we will communicate by other languages.

My years were witness to remarkable wonders at play in the world, many which I saw with my own eyes. The Sailor made maps and guided us how to make open vessels that moved very fast over glass and sand, using sails made of special thin gossamer sheets, fashioned into sails, and given a special coaing which charged in the sun and emitted immense ionic winds which propelled the craft forward, away from the sun, at great speed. many of these craft were built under his careful supervision, then the method was mastered, and teaching of how to fashion these vessels spread outwared to every corner of the known desert. It is only a shame that the Scribes learned of this craft, as well, and used it to increase their control over vassal peoples.

Onto the lands beyond the desert, that vast and endless desert of which so few people have travelled, following compass that the Sailor kept, pointing toward the meeting place of the other Sailors, we now turned our gaze, as the Scribes burned the world around us and tried to do the same to our Academy. We escaped, but only narrowly.

"Only a little farther," he called to the party, many moons after setting out on this massive trek, where water and food were too scarce, but a barge was constructed bearing provisions and supplies for this crew to survive the long journeym though that was coming into question. "QWe cannot eat sunlight as you can, great Sailor."

Deep into the heart of a massive alley we entered, following a deep cut of dry riverbed, farther onward, toward a holy river that flowed across all the years of darkness and desert, supplied by the waters flowing out of a 
## mighty river-making mountain.

"To this mountain, we Sailors have led you. It is the only place remaining on this planet capable of sustaining life, and of that our window of time is very short, for soon its waters will be all ut dried up, we have watched it slowly lose its potency over these centuries, and we have naught but three centuries remaining before the last waters will dry up."

"Twenty years have passed since I fell to this Earth, and all the yers since the other Sailors were here, making preparations for along and arduous task of teaching, helping the last Adani of Earth remember all that is required for stellar travel, to connect with your greater family in the stars. If this quest is not completed, you will all fall into the Great Memory of Gondolla, our Galaxy, and nothing more of your people will ever reach the Center of the Galaxy."

So we traveled on the promise of a metal man, beyond hope and into imminent death, to unite with the promised family who lived beyond the sky.

But as we drew closer, we all began to dream the same dream: white hallowed halls in tall rock, with water flowing everywhere, trickling on marble and echoing sweet music across polished stone.

When we finally arrived, we were greeted by friendly people living peacefully under many flags and tongues, working amicably toward a great reunion with the other peoples scattered out across the Earth, with the goal of uniting them all in this valley, in pursuit of the stars above, again. To that mission of venturing out, across a planet of desert and glass to find the last remaining survivors of disaster, I volunteered.

"We, the awakened children of a people who perished in pursuit of their own folly and demise, do now turn our gaze upward, to the stars, where murmurs and whispers return to us from far reaches where others like us now dwell. These Sailors, our Echoes, guide our way to that far-awy mount, far from our dying planet where we slumbered. Now, launch us back to be in our new Spiritual Homeland."

Sp they did. long after I passed on, but the story does not end with me, and in what my eyes were too old to see, new deeds can be told. The story continues through the record of the Keepers of Memory, as remembered by The Echoes across Gondolla. I, now, am but a record, digitally-kept to tell you the story of The Silver Sailor.

# To set direction with a Solar Sail,
aim your course from the nearest sun, and point to the nearest star. Some distances are not reachable by small barges, so bring sails proportionate to your distance of traversal. We Sailors can spread many sails to travel very fast on ionic winds. Adani can tracel slower, but your lifespan will perish too quickly to travel very far, thus the use of Rebirth Chambers for interstellar travels. Thus, the vessels of clay with the genome serum syspend your Spirit until released to be grown anew at your destination. The process suspends and reanimates life, bt the shaping of life from nothing, and the changing of life to be older, younger, or different in any way, is a separate mystery completely, held by the Healers of both our peoples, Adani and Echo. Vast distances across the stars can be traversed by this method.
In other nations, in other times, many myths spoke of Spirits spread across the wide galaxy, families and friends, loved ones, all living lives at different ages, aging their lifetimes away on different worlds, longing for their families from across the stars, embarking on the long sojourn to death at different corners of the galaxy.

"It is simple, really... You are using some material to transmit some atern over distances, short or great. You have great freedom to explore the materials to send the signals of your choosing. it is music, poetry, no matter the language or pattern you place on the connection... It is always a living principle, like the arrow flung from the bow of an archer. So take aim, and send your commands."

"I will teach you the way to walk between worlds through writing The Walking Script:

"The symbols I sraw bear tokens of Spirit that point to the presence of the writer's inner focus. A picture is ecstatically sculpted by the writer's mind in trance, and connects the pen on the page to the vision. As the vision unfolds, so does the writing, automatically.

"When you are writing in this language, you lift up, out of your writing hand, and leap into the narrative of your story. Along you will travel on roads of your imagination, but for the discerning traveller, entrpoints to pathways and actual other worlds are pepered throughout your vision, available to you if you know how to step upon them, and choose to explore them. Then, though your pen continues writing, it is recounting your deeds in these other worlds; while you steer the keep of your spirit and mind, your body is recountings its words on the page.

"What force steps in to control my hand, you might ask? It is the language itself, and it is powerful."

# Journey Across Ajeiajeia, The Riverlands, Last Home to the Adani

From The Holy Mountain, and its marble city Aja, I weas taken on an exquisite tour of he riverland by the Sailor himself. He knew the river well, already, by sharing mind with the fellow Echoes that had lived there now so long.
First we entered a barge designed for watercraft, sails of gold being rippled by the gentle sun. From the mouth of The Southern Grasslands, we ventured upstream on the many-day journey to Ajja. Up the long river we went, where banks on either side were reds and hues of pink, devoid of life. That same day, we reached a small village built into the rockfaces; cave dwellers, like most of us, whose homes were readymade when out they crawled from their Time Vaults, just like we did. They base us welcome, but onward we sailed. "Many such communities lie between us and The Holy Mountain, and our journey is fire. To tarry is to folly." Still, in the City of Uru, its grand caveworks and building of teetering brick gave me pause and wonder, and it is there we rested for our first night. The following day, we traveled until we reached Edanei, Lightvein. Twilight was upon us when the veins of solar rock were beginning to darken, and the city softly glowed with what was left from basking in the glowing sun the day before. Here we rested through the night, while the caves grew steadily darker through the night. I eagerly rose to meet the sunrise, when the whole cave erupted in hues of bright gold and yellow, sky fire made power in stone all around us.
We set sail shortly after. Long we went through caves made bright by laid lines of solar sand, until finally, near midday, we emerged into a breathtaking sight: emerald green stretching out around us, lilies bending in gentle winds, marcshlands stretches to all sides, and ahead a great lake, and beyond it rose a great mountain, where falling waters glittered in the sunlight, making many pool which climbed up its surface, and a city of margle and gold spread around Her foothills. She was breathtaking, and remains so ever after this, my first visit to The Holy City of Aja. Though its great temples, academies, and palaces had not yet risen, the city glowed at both day and night with such ease on the eyes, it seemed descended directly from the stars.
None could have told us that day that the mountain would dry up when our daughters had daughters who grew to be elders, before our Great Work could be finished, before we could ever complete our vessels to reach the stars... and the wars of that terrible time would bring ruin to us all.

"Only the Wayfarers may guide you all home, now..."

A blessing, a curse, a religion, an epitaph. 

"Through death, we find new life..."

# Speaker for the Machine
"The Adani who can see through the eyes of an Echo, such as you, are called "Speakers for the Machine", and act as a bridge between our worlds. Most Echoes are well-versed in every language, old and new, spoken across all the Adanic worlds. However, very few of the Adani have the gift of sharing inner visions with the Echoes. That is a rare gift, indeed."
The great rush o reach the stars came when the waters of The Holy Mountain couldn't reach the Southern Grasslands, where the Southern Academy stood. Cataract had not seen water from the river now for nearly a century, save what could be piped in from the waterways controlled by The Scribes. All who dwelt in Cataract relied solely on The Scribes' good graces to remain alive.It was Cataract, after all, whose caves ore the greatest lodes of quicksilver in all of Ajeiajeia. By train, the Scribes would load out the spoils mined by the poor peoples of Cataract, and in return, droplets of water were their reward.
"One drop of water per drop of refined quicksilver," the deal with the Scribes went, where a droplet of refined quicksilver could range from one pount to one ton of unrefined ore, the value of which could only be discerned as yield-bearing by the Scribes' own measuring systems, which took place in the walled fortress where the trains arrived and departed.
Most in Cataract seriously doubted that their rations were fairly calculated any longer, and had all but figured out that the Scribes only doled out water in measures of their choosing, which could be influenced poorly by the "criminal acts" committed by the oppressed peoples, such as a child  stepping on a train track, or water being given to those who are in need (for that is only a right given to the Scribes, to disperse water). No matter the amount of ore given over, the people were given a specific amount that could never be exceeded, now matter how much ore the people could raise up to the coffers of the Scribes in their walled fortress. 

Quicksilver, also called Sailor Tar, is a metal found in rocks which, when refined and applied to the bottom surface of anything that must move quickly across sand or glass, such as Sandgliders.

To Aja, all the quicksilver was taken, and from the reservoirs surrounding the Southern Grasslands, the Scribes would draw the water to Cataract through a computer-controlled system of pipes. But with water now no longer reaching the plains, a doom began to fall upon all the Adani of Ajeiajeia, and a resurgence anew was kindled to finish the Great Work. The Southerners, by necessity, migrated upriver, filling already populous centers without enought to support the growing numbers, and the people began to panic. 

This story does not go the way you think it will. For although a single solar sailing vessel was cast out to the stars, intended to reach a faraway place in a long distant future, contain five-hundred Chambers of Rebirth with Adani loaded in, the rest of the planet-bound Adani were destined to perish in hunger and thirst. But, the death of a planet's physical life in whole marks the turning point of Planetary Night, to to such worlds come always first The Wayfarers, to teach and guide the few Adani capable of making the Walk Between Worlds, who may then guide the other Spirits of their people on the Great Journey to the Center of the Galaxy. And following, when all Spirits have been freed from the mortal coil, the Twii Lii approach, transforming those lost Spirits into moondust, bringing them into the Ring of Broken Moons, where they may be remade anew as fresh Spirits in the coming Galactic Day. And so, in the final years of Ajeiajeia, the WAyfarers came, but were rejected by Farrah Herself, having gone mad in Her final century of rulership at the hands of The High Scribe, and it was in secret this art was taught to the few who would listen, and thus there were shepherds capable of making the walk, and leading those of their people whose Spirits had developed enough to follow them.

The first and most important step in preparation for being preserved into a Chamber of Rebirth is full assimilation of Truegold into the body that will undergo preservation. This requires many baths in purest Truegold solution across several months, until the solution finally sets. The skin becomes radiant and golden over this process. It cannot be performed after a person has died, and one who dies midway through this process is not saved from departure of the mortal coil. The Living Adani, haing cured in TrueGold completely, will, at some point, undergo a rapid transformation, where the gold becomes a poison in their body, and begins to sap their life away. This is an incredibly dangerous moment in the process; at this exact time, the Adani must enter the brine, not before and not long after. This marks the final moments of that Adani's life, and it is into that brine where they must die, in order later to be reborn. Every steopp in the process myst be performed precisely, lest the Spirit be ost to the cosmic winds.

An Echo discovered this power, long ago before the world was burned. Though the math was perfect, the first few Adani to try it were lost, and the Echo nearly paid for that malpractice with its life.

---

So the Wayfarers gave that flock of Adanic Spirits a choice: 

Venture straight to the heart of the Falaxy and be saved from the Long Night, or venture to the planet where their pwople will reawaken after their long sailing across the stars... but at the risk of them *all* becoming fallen spawn of Miro, and become vassals of the darkness in Cosmic Night, dwelling in Miraj, for all eternity. 

Most of the host chose to follow their brethren, no matter the cost; they would remain one people. Only they who came from the Scribal class, good of heart but not united in same spirit with the whole of their people, chose to make the journey ahead, to The Mountain of Light at the Heart of Gondolla.

---

"Some get the sleeping sickness when resurrected, especially when you've been resurrected a few times, like I have. I may look thirty suns, but I was reborn seven times spanning six-hundred years. I cannot remember who I was as a child, nor the face of my mother. But, I will tell you one thing that is for certain: there is no way in the galaxy I'm about to spend my last years starving on this burned-up planet."

It impressed Ani that someone could remember the stellar worlds, so few remember anything after so long a slumber as they collectively shared.

"I came very long after you all had gone to sleep. The sky was already dark, but some patches of sunlight were allowed to kiss the Earth's skin again. My solar ship has no Echo, for they are very rare in the galaxy, so none of the Sky Sailors saw me entering. I crashed in a place that is very far from here, and my Rebirth Chamber did not trigger. It was one of your lot on Sandgliders that found my broken ship sticking out the side of a rocky thrush. Lucky my big clay pot of Spirit soup wasn't smashed; they brought me to the Valley of Rebirth beside Aja, and there the priest Abbu brought life to me."
