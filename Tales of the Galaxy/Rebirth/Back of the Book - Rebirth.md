Once we sailed among the stars. Once we conquered death itself. Now our golden age lies buried beneath desert sands and silent temples. In a land ruled by fading light and gathering shadows, Ani—a young dreamer with the soul of an ancient wanderer—seeks what his elders no longer remember. When a silver star falls from the night sky, Ani discovers a secret friendship that will ignite a rebellion and awaken a cosmic legacy.

Haunted by ethereal echoes and pursued by those who hoard the keys to life and death, Ani must cross a dying world of whispering dunes and sacred waters. Rebirth is at once the tale of a fallen kingdom’s last hope and a journey of the spirit beyond the veil of mortality. In the holy city of waterfalls, beneath the Mountain of Light, destiny and dusk converge—a prince uncrowned, an ancient people reborn, and a universe poised on the brink of a new dawn. Lyrical, profound, and unafraid to delve into the darkest night before the dawn, Rebirth beckons you to sail the ionic winds of wonder toward a fate as infinite as the stars.
