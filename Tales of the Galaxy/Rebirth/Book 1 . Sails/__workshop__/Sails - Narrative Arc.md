### Silver Sailor
The Sailor's fall makes a crater in The Glass Flats. Ani waits with the Sailor until daybreak, when the villagers, and The Scribes, come to investigate the "fallen star".

### Coming of Age
Ani's ceremony is shaken by intense commotion as the Scribes interrogate the villagers. Ani's family do not reveal his dreams to the Scribes. 

Transition: At twilight, Ani sneaks out and climbs the hill overlooking where the Sailor fell. There is nothing but broken glass, as a small caravan's torches can be seen leading far off in the distance.

Years later, Ani dreams of a dark mountain where the Silver Sailor's voice faintly calls his name. He awakens as the Scribes take him to that dark mountain. He meets the Sailor, learns that his village is free, and the Sailor will teach them how to make solar sails to return to their star family.

### Scribal Crimes
Ani and a ragtag group secretly travel to other villages, uniting the people against the Scribes. Silver reads his mind and sees his intentions, but warns him: from this aggression will come greater still; do not add heat to hot sands. Ani acquiesces, but the ragtag bunch lead fights against the Scribes in many villages.
