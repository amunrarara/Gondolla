# Scribes Awaken

The Scribes, the personification of Control, gone out of control, across many centuries. In Sails, the Scribes are the dwellers of many Vaults that were dug into Dark Mountain, a mountain of dark rock jutting out, alone in the desert. In their mountain, they had many veins of solarstone, laid out with precision from the same Adani who were awoken, who placed themselves to sleep at the same time, and triggered an awakening process that brought their whole hive to live. That mountain is the very same Control Center from which the Scribes ruled their network of chittering wires across all the planet, listening and thinking and harvesting thoughts from all the peoples of the planet, perfecting their methods of control, mastering machines and terrorizing all with their silent weapons in a quiet war. Their fortress, though reduced to this moutain of rock and rubble, still held many secrets, its bones still solid like a tooth on the surface of the sun dry desert. The work of the Scribes was mostly preserved; at the heart of the mountain lies a chamber, a centermost place, a hollowed-out circle with dozens of concentric rings where many could gather, speak, and share information with the others. Outward from Core Control, the halls and chambers held one-hundred and fourty-four Scribes long-asleep in their Rebirth chambers, of whom 47 were awakened, while the rest had perished in the long night. On awakening, like a hive of wasps, to their Terminals they flocked, checking instruments they'd cast across the planet before the fireflowers bloomed, finding everything, absolutely everything, they could learn about what had just transpired whilst they slept. After seventeen days, a deliberation meeting was called in Core Control. Presenting all data to all Scribes present, they had assessed from their instruments that the planet was completely destroyed; no life at all could be yet found upon it, save Vaults some Vaults that had held true, waiting to be awakened. Checking the food and water preserves in their own Vault's stores, the fourty-seven Scribes could live their stable lives for seven-hundred years. In the deepest place was kept their Solar Sail, and barge capable of carrying all the one-hundred and fourty-four Scribes across the stars in golden sleep.

"Since we did not cast our sail out to the stars in time," spoke one Scribe, called Imu, "we have paid for it dearly. Wasn't it Sheia that said to us, 'do not leave for the stars yet, peace may be had yet still'? What peace remains after fireflowers bloom? We knew it was coming, I myself provided evidence that stated so. It was indisputable, the fires were coming, and we could have escaped".

Sheia stepped forth to her podium. Core Control turned toward her.

"To bring up a matter of hostility among a court of fourty-seven remaining fellows is dangerous and reckless, Imu. We remain, and if any chance we have of reaching our home in the stars again, we must unfurl those sails again. So set forth, I say!"

But beyond Core Control, the rest of their precious Control Center was totally destroyed. They assessed that a fireflower had been aimed directly at Core Control, but had missed by several hundred steps, thus preventing what little was left from being lost forever. And with it, their materials and tools for launching a Solar Sail into the sky.  Without beams of laser light, their ships could not reach the velocity they'd need to reach the next star in good time, and they knew from their study that Cosmic Night was approaching very soon. The warmth of the galaxy core would keep them alive for uncountable years, and that's where they aimed to go. 

"We will perish, but The Scribes will live on." That old oath.

The Scribes didn't originate on that planet. They were a faction, spread out across the small reach of galaxy that the Adani could traverse in ships made of metal with sails of solar silk. Their greatest creation, Echoes, reached much farther than the Adani, before they could no longer reproduce. There are legends of old, legendary Adani that still sleep in their Rebirth chambers, waiting for an intrepid adventurer to come along and awaken them. 

### ...ships made of metal with sails of solar silk.

Scene: Across many planets, across many stars, Rebirth chambers are opening... Golden light pours forth, and radiant gold people step out of them, into the dark of night. 

"The Adani are awakening..."

Awakening to know that they are the last of their kind, that reproduction has not been saved in their slumbers.

"For the mystery is, though many of us have been sleeping far longer than others, we have not reached nearly as far down the chain of progenitors, and yet still we awaken incapable of reproduction. Fascinating, and devastating. I think I will go back to sleep again, after all."

"I'm so sorry to tell you... we have lost the recipe for truegold and can find no more sources of it. We cannot be reborn."
