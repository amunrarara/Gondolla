Ani recounts his childhood dreams as he sits in a dry riverbed and looks at the stars.

Transition: The Silver Sailor falls from the sky

---

I looked into the sky tonight and saw it clear: a strand of shining silver that shot across the streak of stars abov the wanderig red light. It was fact, bright for only a moment, but once I had seen it, I knew it was real.
"The Silver Sailor", I used to call him, when I saw him first in a dream. I could fly in my dreams, so I jumped the way I always did, with my arms up in the air, and climbed, climbed, climbed into the air, into the lower skies, then the higher abbove the clouds, until finally rising to where the open, waving sands could be seen in all directions, but started flaling away to make room for encroaching night. 

 n the deep of sky's night, I saw the Silver Sailor, a man of silver metal, perfection of the human form sculpted like a statue, brilliant arms and powerful legs pulling golden sails on a metal barge like the keelships of old. He was steering ever forward, at incredible speed, toward the Sun which rose quickly ahead. Many times following, in the dreams I would have in the years of my youth, I would sometimes come to him in the deepest hours of his night, and find him still and as motionless as stone. The sun would always find him, bringing him back to life, when his sailing journey began anew.
In my ten years from young ceremony to adult initiation, the Sailor started speaking to me.
What he would say, at first, made no sense to me. Sound produces shapes and phenomena that changed the dream by his mysterious voice as he uttered words unlike any I'd ever heard before. until finally, I started speaking to him, and slowly my words were returned to me, increasing in meaning and clarity, in every single dream.
Eventually we spoke in sentences, then paragraphs, novels, and aeons, for dreams can last aeons, and have, until everything I learned became picture complete: the Earth's first blossoms in the past before the past, the oceans bearing spirits made flesh by the sea, the land-walkers, great monsters, then mankind sculpting all with their purpose, then burning it with glorious anger. 
We sat together on his barge nd looked down on the Earth and the skies below were set ablaze with many flowers of fire, then endless hours following of blackness and ash clouds, olts of purple lightning, and stillness.  I saw the patience, unending patience, on the face of the Sailor as we looked down on the past he could not forget. 
The dark gave way to the light, an Earth painted by sand, and glass.
When adulthood approached me, dreams were a luxury not always earned, but sometimes too I would sit on that barge when my eyes were closed too long, and those were the visits most vivid.
Now, tonight he told me, the eve before I become a man, he would sail overhead, and I'd see his barge with my own eyes...

And now, having seen the silver streak above, now I know that I must do what he told me to do.
