Scene: Across many planets, across many stars, Rebirth chambers are opening... Golden light pours forth, and radiant gold people step out of them, into the dark of night. 

"The Adani are awakening..."

Awakening to know that they are the last of their kind, that reproduction has not been saved in their slumbers.

"For the mystery is, though many of us have been sleeping far longer than others, we have not reached nearly as far down the chain of progenitors, and yet still we awaken incapable of reproduction. Fascinating, and devastating. I think I will go back to sleep again, after all."

"I'm so sorry to tell you... we have lost the recipe for truegold and can find no more sources of it. We cannot be reborn."

"This... my last life? No more slumber, just the long death? This is terrible..."

Each Adani deals with it in a different way. Every Adani must die, of course, despite their many long slumbers, when Rebirthed they remain at the age they were when entering the chamber, and continue to age just the same when awakened. Many have not even come to grips with this fact, stretching youth and hiding from the truth of time. It is they who, when met with their own death and the death of all their people, cannot handle themselves in the world unto which they were awakened, which is why the Adani are not encountered much any longer.

The Wayfarers always make fun of the Adani who never think to try the walking the Ways Between Worlds. 

A particularly pesky Wayfarer once told his companions:

"All across Gondolla in those hunks of pretty junk, sleeping seven-hundred years to reach the next adventure. What insane thinking! They built their whole society around that; whole families and tribes falling into golden sleep together to awaken at their destinations all at the same time. Whole hosts showing up on distant planets, Rebirthing, and walking out into a world they might have only heard about. And going on to do it again, and again, and again! What insanity. You think at least one of them would listen to what we have to say... but when they're on the planet we incarnate onto and we speak to them about the Ways, they laugh in our faces, apply their rouge and swing their sashes, stepping into those ruddy pots, drenching themselves in that stinking vat of brine to fall asleep for the whole shining ride. It's unthinkable. I can take three swirls afoot, walk seventeen steps with my right hand facing the sunrise, and I'm lifted. Off to the next star, I'll see you in seven-hundred years if I'm still hanging round that place! I'm arriving in seven hours, but enjoy the ride, don't meet the Kingfisher, and off on another adventure I go!"

"There's something beautiful about it, I think," Sheia said, softly. "We're alive now, and we can't go back to sleep. I can't have children, we can't raise children, and any Adani we meet will be the last Adani ever alive.

"If we find another Adani who's sleeping, do we wake them up? Or, do we let them sleep? Some are grateful to stretch their legs planet-side again, others are mortified by the galaxy they've stepped into; so, I'm not really sure which way to go, but most times, I take it like a kind of duty, that we all can walk free of those chambers again. If last breath is drawn by an Adani, the galaxy will move on. Life has its many forms, and we are but the breath of a planet who once loved us."

"We are rare, in this galaxy."

"These Adani were awakened on our mother planet, who was lost to fire. But their women bear children, and have done so for many generations; but upon leaving our mother planet, they lost this ability. But they bring truegold in vast quantity; enough for every living Adani to take golden sleep three more times. Therefore I say, we return to our mother, that we bring her our gifts from all the galaxy, and learn her ways to bask in the mystery that allows us again to bear children, let the Adani flourish again!"

"But our mother is too close to the sun, now. There is no way we can sustain ourselves. There is not even any water."

At this, a citizen of Cataract stepped forth. "It is time we break the seal on our silence. We, the people of Cataract, have known for many centuries now how to locate the Underground Ocean. We, as children becoming adults, visit it once, and swim in its waters. It is deep, and vast. Many of our people are explorers of its manifold pathways, covered in stone, and some even plumb its depths in special crafts. All is drinkable, they have said, and all is teeming with life."

At this, a mighty council united, and all Adani made ready to set sail for their homeland, their mother planet.

A tremor at the edges of light woke the Wayfarer, sleeping in their cell in Aieishanu, The Highest Mount, just before the gates to Eia. A sensitive Spirit and kin to the Adani, born to the homeworld of the Adani, awakened in the farther reaches of their empires, and returned once to pay homages to their Motherworld, a dear kinship of heart between Motherworld and Spirit were deeply alive between them. He mourned when the Great Darkness of that aeon approached, for so few of his fellows from this crop of young souls had been able to master the lightbody, thus so few made it free of the middle ground
