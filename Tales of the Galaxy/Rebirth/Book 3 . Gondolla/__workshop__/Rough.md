By grace, the Spirits of that Sun grew strong, and thrust out a mighty sword of light; the very echo of Divinidad the Mirrorbreaker. By the mount which it arose from the effulgence of its peak, a mighty moutain of light jutted forth, and made a bridge straight out from their Sun, as a road for the Sun Warriors from Vigil to traverse in times of need.

"We, the Sun Warriors, wield the very shards of Divinidad, the mightiest Sword of Light which broke the great mirror between the [[Áeia]] and [[Shaddah]], and shattered The Great Divide, leaving the shards of broken starglass afloat across Void."

"We, the Warriors... we, the Mirrorbreakers... we, the Wielders of Divinidad..."
