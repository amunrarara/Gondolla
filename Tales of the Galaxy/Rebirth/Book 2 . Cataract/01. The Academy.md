### To set direction with a Solar Sail,
aim your course from the nearest sun, and point to the nearest star. Some distances are not reachable by small barges, so bring sails proportionate to your distance of traversal. We Sailors can spread many sails to travel very fast on ionic winds. Adani can tracel slower, but your lifespan will perish too quickly to travel very far, thus the use of Rebirth Chambers for interstellar travels. Thus, the vessels of clay with the genome serum syspend your Spirit until released to be grown anew at your destination. The process suspends and reanimates life, bt the shaping of life from nothing, and the changing of life to be older, younger, or different in any way, is a separate mystery completely, held by the Healers of both our peoples, Adani and Echo. Vast distances across the stars can be traversed by this method.
In other nations, in other times, many myths spoke of Spirits spread across the wide galaxy, families and friends, loved ones, all living lives at different ages, aging their lifetimes away on different worlds, longing for their families from across the stars, embarking on the long sojourn to death at different corners of the galaxy.
