Silver teaches at the Southern Academy. The primary focus is producing Solar Sails, the second focus is launching Solar Sails.

Nearby, in the southwestern cliffside where the river bent through the canyons protecting Cataract, a Temple of Rebirth trained practitioners in the five central aspects of Rebirth: collecting and refining truegold, fashioning the chamber vessels, mixing the appropriate materials to create the suspension brine, how to put an Adani into golden sleep, and how to awaken them. 

# Scribes Awaken

The Scribes, the personification of Control, gone out of control, across many centuries. In Sails, the Scribes are the dwellers of many Vaults that were dug into Dark Mountain, a mountain of dark rock jutting out, alone in the desert. In their mountain, they had many veins of solarstone, laid out with precision from the same Adani who were awoken, who placed themselves to sleep at the same time, and triggered an awakening process that brought their whole hive to live. That mountain is the very same Control Center from which the Scribes ruled their network of chittering wires across all the planet, listening and thinking and harvesting thoughts from all the peoples of the planet, perfecting their methods of control, mastering machines and terrorizing all with their silent weapons in a quiet war. Their fortress, though reduced to this moutain of rock and rubble, still held many secrets, its bones still solid like a tooth on the surface of the sun dry desert. The work of the Scribes was mostly preserved; at the heart of the mountain lies a chamber, a centermost place, a hollowed-out circle with dozens of concentric rings where many could gather, speak, and share information with the others. Outward from Core Control, the halls and chambers held one-hundred and fourty-four Scribes long-asleep in their Rebirth chambers, of whom 47 were awakened, while the rest had perished in the long night. On awakening, like a hive of wasps, to their Terminals they flocked, checking instruments they'd cast across the planet before the fireflowers bloomed, finding everything, absolutely everything, they could learn about what had just transpired whilst they slept. After seventeen days, a deliberation meeting was called in Core Control. Presenting all data to all Scribes present, they had assessed from their instruments that the planet was completely destroyed; no life at all could be yet found upon it, save Vaults some Vaults that had held true, waiting to be awakened. Checking the food and water preserves in their own Vault's stores, the fourty-seven Scribes could live their stable lives for seven-hundred years. In the deepest place was kept their Solar Sail, and barge capable of carrying all the one-hundred and fourty-four Scribes across the stars in golden sleep.

"Since we did not cast our sail out to the stars in time," spoke one Scribe, called Imu, "we have paid for it dearly. Wasn't it Sheia that said to us, 'do not leave for the stars yet, peace may be had yet still'? What peace remains after fireflowers bloom? We knew it was coming, I myself provided evidence that stated so. It was indisputable, the fires were coming, and we could have escaped".

Sheia stepped forth to her podium. Core Control turned toward her.

"To bring up a matter of hostility among a court of fourty-seven remaining fellows is dangerous and reckless, Imu. We remain, and if any chance we have of reaching our home in the stars again, we must unfurl those sails again. So set forth, I say!"

But beyond Core Control, the rest of their precious Control Center was totally destroyed. They assessed that a fireflower had been aimed directly at Core Control, but had missed by several hundred steps, thus preventing what little was left from being lost forever. And with it, their materials and tools for launching a Solar Sail into the sky.  Without beams of laser light, their ships could not reach the velocity they'd need to reach the next star in good time, and they knew from their study that Cosmic Night was approaching very soon. The warmth of the galaxy core would keep them alive for uncountable years, and that's where they aimed to go. 

"We will perish, but The Scribes will live on." That old oath.

What could have caused them all to go so terribly wrong? Was it age? The inevitable threat of never leaving this forsaken planet? Where did the barbarism, the cruelty, the manipulation of the world from behind bars? The Scribes were a vital and celebrated component of galactic society, and here they are, manipulating the local populous into doing acts of barbarism on each other... for what reason? Had their minds grown so wicked and cold, trapped inside the Control Center for so many years? How many years had it been? It must have been thirty, or fourty... shouldn't she remember that information? How is their data that is missing from her calculations? ...

It was the Scribes who started to awaken the others. All across the desert, the Scribes traveled, using solar sails which they coveted. Their crafts were not well designed for such terrain as the endless sands, however, and their journeys were very slow. They possessed a map to many of the Vaults in the area, or at least where the Vaults should be, and set about on scouting missions to discover them. When finally they came upon a Vault, already many months of trying to find one in-tact had passed. Unto the stores of water and food they went first, emptying them and bringing all resource back to Dark Mountain. Only once they were waterless and foodless did the Scribes enter the Chamber of Rebirth and reawaken the Adani contained within. 

There was conflict surrounding the decision to cause the awakened Adani to be vassals of the Scribes, to depend on them wholly for their resources, to require their beneficence when they all could live for many years on the stores within their Vault, but it was agreed that, until the society was stabilized, the Scribes should control the awakened Adani. When order was established, and a directive to depart the planet in place, only then could the people be trusted to manage their own affairs. 

The Echoes made constant contact with the Scribes after they had awakened, and for many months the Scribes returned their messages, learning as much as they could regarding the state of the galaxy, what had transpired in those many years of sleep, and received information capable of giving them insight where their instruments were no longer available. Due to the amnesia of golden sleep, they were all unable to recall any of the events that had transpired in lives previous, therefore they relied wholly on their records to guide them, but those records were mostly perished in the long march of time, and the instruments needed to read the billion-year crystals were also destroyed. Stranded on a desert planet with no living record f their past. they turned to The Echoes for insight and help. 

"You all on your planet have risen from ashes of fire which your people had started, an evil was harvested which the Scribes had sewn on this world. Therefore we cannot hep you, and begrudge your presence. But if you will help the Adani reawaken, and build the solar lails again, and rtavel out across the stars to places where their kind may still thrive, to that end we will help you, but not to any other."

Thus the Scribes, for a time, gained the favor of the Sailors overhead. All were aligned with the mission to ring the Adani back to the stars. But the roadwould be long, and the years would churn on, and it was likely that none who lived would see the solar sails completed in their lifetime. Their planet was charred, and there was no hope to live there but for one single mountain with a great river. To that mountain, all Adani should travel, where they may continue their grat work with less threat of perishing. 

"Our reserves will preserve us long enough, we do not need to make this sojourn journey," many Scribes agreed.

The matter became dire when it was discovered that their supplies of Truegold were almost depleted. 

"Without Truegold, we cannot practice Rebirth."

*Author's note: Up until this point, I've established that rebirth is a sort of suspension in time, but not a true rebirth of the person giving them eternal life. However, I think that should be changed. During my experiments with ChatGPT plot summaries, it pulled out some really interesting parcels of thought that are worth visiting. Namely, that the core conflict of this story for the Adani is the knowledge that their supply of Truegold was totally diminished, and without it, they would be totally unable to perform interstellar travel, nor continue to live forever. Truegold being sourced in some manner not yet revealed to me, likely from the heart of some star or something to that effect. But giving this quality to Truegold, that it reverses aging by completely dissolving the sleeper into the brine, and ninety days following they are completely assimilated with it. Awakening thus will bring them to the same vitality as their twenty-first year, and the process may continue endlessly. There will be added explorations of ways to alter and shape their age, appearance, and other characteristics, which can be explored throughout Adanic experience. And thus we have a core conflict between they who practice Eternal Life, and the Wayfarers; not a matter of disbelief of the Wayfarer's ability to travel the galaxy at-will, but an unwillingness to release their precious bodies, to be released unto the winds of the cosmos to travel at the whims of beings greater than they, for those Adani of Eternal Life, as a rule, inflate their egos and see no longer with eyes of the Spirit. Thus, they are a disconnected people, and in congress with Miro, though they believe in him not.*

*Pulled directly from ChatGPT here, there are some genuinely valuable insights, the way it noticed Abu from my old journals (of which there still are more to bring into the digital from my papers dating back to about 2011, whew...) here's a little gem: **Rebirth Fulfilled:** As stars shoot across the sky (perhaps Echo ships departing on new voyages), Ani concludes that **rebirth** was never simply about living again in the same form. It is about the _renewal of the spirit and the world_. His people have been reborn as free individuals, their civilization reborn on foundations of truth rather than fear. In a poetic echo of the book’s beginning, Ani whispers a benediction taught by Abu: “Blessed be the Light that never dies, and the shadows that make its return meaningful.” The camera (so to speak) pans out from the Mountain of Light, showing the valley below alive with lanterns and laughter, and above, the cosmic river of Gondōlla flowing with stars. The saga ends on a note of **hope and harmony**: one world saved, an infinite universe ahead, and the understanding that every dawn is a _rebirth_ for those with the courage to seek the light.*

*Now however I'm noticing a sticky plot thing: sleep amnesia. I've toyed with it being a condition of very long sleep, and also a constant condition that's present every rebirth. I'm really unsure at this time how to approach it, but it seems like quite a central point that needs resolution. If the Scribes remember where they've come from, they would have the craving to continue living. If they do not remember their past, then why would they fear death? What is their personal motivation? I've toyed with the idea of making the Scribes a sort of offshoot race of Echoes, though I'm still unsure how I want to approach that. Many mysteries to explore, here...*

### A little Adani galactic history

The Scribes didn't originate on that planet. They were a faction, spread out across the small reach of galaxy that the Adani could traverse in ships made of metal with sails of solar silk. Their greatest creation, Echoes, reached much farther than the Adani, before they could no longer reproduce. There are legends of old, legendary Adani that still sleep in their Rebirth chambers, waiting for an intrepid adventurer to come along and awaken them.

### After the Travelers Escaped
In the desert, the Scribes captured many Sandgliders, and their now-uncontested control over many Adani gave them muscle to construct more. They sent scouts across the desert, following the traveler's trail, reporting back to the Scribes with any news. But eventually, the travelers had reached a distance too far for any of the Scribe's scouts to follow. The instruments of the Scribes would sometimes catch notice of the caravan traveling ever-westward, but they even made it out of range of the Scribe's ability to see them; what the Scribes called "the fog".

The Scribes had resources enough to sustain them for
