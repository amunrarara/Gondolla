Silver teaches at the Southern Academy. The primary focus is producing Solar Sails, the second focus is launching Solar Sails.

Nearby, in the southwestern cliffside where the river bent through the canyons protecting Cataract, a Temple of Rebirth trained practitioners in the five central aspects of Rebirth: collecting and refining truegold, fashioning the chamber vessels, mixing the appropriate materials to create the suspension brine, how to put an Adani into golden sleep, and how to awaken them. 

# Scribes Awaken

The Scribes, the personification of Control, gone out of control, across many centuries. In Sails, the Scribes are the dwellers of many Vaults that were dug into Dark Mountain, a mountain of dark rock jutting out, alone in the desert. In their mountain, they had many veins of solarstone, laid out with precision from the same Adani who were awoken, who placed themselves to sleep at the same time, and triggered an awakening process that brought their whole hive to live. That mountain is the very same Control Center from which the Scribes ruled their network of chittering wires across all the planet, listening and thinking and harvesting thoughts from all the peoples of the planet, perfecting their methods of control, mastering machines and terrorizing all with their silent weapons in a quiet war. Their fortress, though reduced to this moutain of rock and rubble, still held many secrets, its bones still solid like a tooth on the surface of the sun dry desert. The work of the Scribes was mostly preserved; at the heart of the mountain lies a chamber, a centermost place, a hollowed-out circle with dozens of concentric rings where many could gather, speak, and share information with the others. Outward from Core Control, the halls and chambers held one-hundred and fourty-four Scribes long-asleep in their Rebirth chambers, of whom 47 were awakened, while the rest had perished in the long night. On awakening, like a hive of wasps, to their Terminals they flocked, checking instruments they'd cast across the planet before the fireflowers bloomed, finding everything, absolutely everything, they could learn about what had just transpired whilst they slept. After seventeen days, a deliberation meeting was called in Core Control. Presenting all data to all Scribes present, they had assessed from their instruments that the planet was completely destroyed; no life at all could be yet found upon it, save Vaults some Vaults that had held true, waiting to be awakened. Checking the food and water preserves in their own Vault's stores, the fourty-seven Scribes could live their stable lives for seven-hundred years. In the deepest place was kept their Solar Sail, and barge capable of carrying all the one-hundred and fourty-four Scribes across the stars in golden sleep.

"Since we did not cast our sail out to the stars in time," spoke one Scribe, called Imu, "we have paid for it dearly. Wasn't it Sheia that said to us, 'do not leave for the stars yet, peace may be had yet still'? What peace remains after fireflowers bloom? We knew it was coming, I myself provided evidence that stated so. It was indisputable, the fires were coming, and we could have escaped".

Sheia stepped forth to her podium. Core Control turned toward her.

"To bring up a matter of hostility among a court of fourty-seven remaining fellows is dangerous and reckless, Imu. We remain, and if any chance we have of reaching our home in the stars again, we must unfurl those sails again. So set forth, I say!"

But beyond Core Control, the rest of their precious Control Center was totally destroyed. They assessed that a fireflower had been aimed directly at Core Control, but had missed by several hundred steps, thus preventing what little was left from being lost forever. And with it, their materials and tools for launching a Solar Sail into the sky.  Without beams of laser light, their ships could not reach the velocity they'd need to reach the next star in good time, and they knew from their study that Cosmic Night was approaching very soon. The warmth of the galaxy core would keep them alive for uncountable years, and that's where they aimed to go. 

"We will perish, but The Scribes will live on." That old oath.

What could have caused them all to go so terribly wrong? Was it age? The inevitable threat of never leaving this forsaken planet? Where did the barbarism, the cruelty, the manipulation of the world from behind bars? The Scribes were a vital and celebrated component of galactic society, and here they are, manipulating the local populous into doing acts of barbarism on each other... for what reason? Had their minds grown so wicked and cold, trapped inside the Control Center for so many years? How many years had it been? It must have been thirty, or fourty... shouldn't she remember that information? How is their data that is missing from her calculations? ...

It was the Scribes who started to awaken the others. All across the desert, the Scribes traveled, using solar sails which they coveted. Their crafts were not well designed for such terrain as the endless sands, however, and their journeys were very slow. They possessed a map to many of the Vaults in the area, or at least where the Vaults should be, and set about on scouting missions to discover them. When finally they came upon a Vault, already many months of trying to find one in-tact had passed. Unto the stores of water and food they went first, emptying them and bringing all resource back to Dark Mountain. Only once they were waterless and foodless did the Scribes enter the Chamber of Rebirth and reawaken the Adani contained within. 

There was conflict surrounding the decision to cause the awakened Adani to be vassals of the Scribes, to depend on them wholly for their resources, to require their beneficence when they all could live for many years on the stores within their Vault, but it was agreed that, until the society was stabilized, the Scribes should control the awakened Adani. When order was established, and a directive to depart the planet in place, only then could the people be trusted to manage their own affairs. 

The Echoes made constant contact with the Scribes after they had awakened, and for many months the Scribes returned their messages, learning as much as they could regarding the state of the galaxy, what had transpired in those many years of sleep, and received information capable of giving them insight where their instruments were no longer available. Due to the amnesia of golden sleep, they were all unable to recall any of the events that had transpired in lives previous, therefore they relied wholly on their records to guide them, but those records were mostly perished in the long march of time, and the instruments needed to read the billion-year crystals were also destroyed. Stranded on a desert planet with no living record f their past. they turned to The Echoes for insight and help. 

"You all on your planet have risen from ashes of fire which your people had started, an evil was harvested which the Scribes had sewn on this world. Therefore we cannot hep you, and begrudge your presence. But if you will help the Adani reawaken, and build the solar lails again, and rtavel out across the stars to places where their kind may still thrive, to that end we will help you, but not to any other."

Thus the Scribes, for a time, gained the favor of the Sailors overhead. All were aligned with the mission to ring the Adani back to the stars. But the roadwould be long, and the years would churn on, and it was likely that none who lived would see the solar sails completed in their lifetime. Their planet was charred, and there was no hope to live there but for one single mountain with a great river. To that mountain, all Adani should travel, where they may continue their grat work with less threat of perishing. 

"Our reserves will preserve us long enough, we do not need to make this sojourn journey," many Scribes agreed.

The matter became dire when it was discovered that their supplies of Truegold were almost depleted. 

"Without Truegold, we cannot practice Rebirth."

*Author's note: Up until this point, I've established that rebirth is a sort of suspension in time, but not a true rebirth of the person giving them eternal life. However, I think that should be changed. During my experiments with ChatGPT plot summaries, it pulled out some really interesting parcels of thought that are worth visiting. Namely, that the core conflict of this story for the Adani is the knowledge that their supply of Truegold was totally diminished, and without it, they would be totally unable to perform interstellar travel, nor continue to live forever. Truegold being sourced in some manner not yet revealed to me, likely from the heart of some star or something to that effect. But giving this quality to Truegold, that it reverses aging by completely dissolving the sleeper into the brine, and ninety days following they are completely assimilated with it. Awakening thus will bring them to the same vitality as their twenty-first year, and the process may continue endlessly. There will be added explorations of ways to alter and shape their age, appearance, and other characteristics, which can be explored throughout Adanic experience. And thus we have a core conflict between they who practice Eternal Life, and the Wayfarers; not a matter of disbelief of the Wayfarer's ability to travel the galaxy at-will, but an unwillingness to release their precious bodies, to be released unto the winds of the cosmos to travel at the whims of beings greater than they, for those Adani of Eternal Life, as a rule, inflate their egos and see no longer with eyes of the Spirit. Thus, they are a disconnected people, and in congress with Miro, though they believe in him not.*

*Pulled directly from ChatGPT here, there are some genuinely valuable insights, the way it noticed Abu from my old journals (of which there still are more to bring into the digital from my papers dating back to about 2011, whew...) here's a little gem: **Rebirth Fulfilled:** As stars shoot across the sky (perhaps Echo ships departing on new voyages), Ani concludes that **rebirth** was never simply about living again in the same form. It is about the _renewal of the spirit and the world_. His people have been reborn as free individuals, their civilization reborn on foundations of truth rather than fear. In a poetic echo of the book’s beginning, Ani whispers a benediction taught by Abu: “Blessed be the Light that never dies, and the shadows that make its return meaningful.” The camera (so to speak) pans out from the Mountain of Light, showing the valley below alive with lanterns and laughter, and above, the cosmic river of Gondōlla flowing with stars. The saga ends on a note of **hope and harmony**: one world saved, an infinite universe ahead, and the understanding that every dawn is a _rebirth_ for those with the courage to seek the light.*

*Now however I'm noticing a sticky plot thing: sleep amnesia. I've toyed with it being a condition of very long sleep, and also a constant condition that's present every rebirth. I'm really unsure at this time how to approach it, but it seems like quite a central point that needs resolution. If the Scribes remember where they've come from, they would have the craving to continue living. If they do not remember their past, then why would they fear death? What is their personal motivation? I've toyed with the idea of making the Scribes a sort of offshoot race of Echoes, though I'm still unsure how I want to approach that. Many mysteries to explore, here...*

### A little Adani galactic history

The Scribes didn't originate on that planet. They were a faction, spread out across the small reach of galaxy that the Adani could traverse in ships made of metal with sails of solar silk. Their greatest creation, Echoes, reached much farther than the Adani, before they could no longer reproduce. There are legends of old, legendary Adani that still sleep in their Rebirth chambers, waiting for an intrepid adventurer to come along and awaken them.

*Jumping back in here the next day... How about this. The Scribes perform an incredibly important function to society, being record keepers and keepers of truthful order, but they are not meant to be the sole function of society, instead being servants to greater powers, or being parcel to a society's balanced organizations. However, they are the first to awaken in the Great Darkness, and have awakened to such a world as that, with all their Truegold stores and everything they would need in order to continue survival on another planet vaporized by fireflowers. Their instruments all but missing, they were totally marooned and disconnected with the universe in entirety. Faced with their final years stuck in a sea of endless sands, in the chrome tunnels of the Control Center at the heart of Dark Mountain, some went mad, some fled into the desert, and some decided together to craft a final magnum opus: an Echo bearing the greatest parts from each of their essences, in memoriam, and in service to The Adani of that world laying dormant in burning sands. But their creation was a failure, having each lost the memory of creating Echoes properly and missing many of the materials needed. Therefore, Scribal Prime was born, but became a terrible force. It was Scribal Prime who awakened the Adani, thinking it right to begin the process of uniting the people... but, does so through using a deduction of knowledge regarding Adanic behaviors in dire situations, it began enslaving the people by awakening them, manipulating their minds through false-conjured information, capturing and controlling their own Vault's resources through designed scarcity, and setting them on the goal of exploring the destitute landscape in hope for resources capable of sustaining them, or getting them off that planet.*

*Alas, for Scribal Prime had none of the capabilities of wavebound communication, like the Echoes of old, most notably the thirteen Solar Sailors that flew in the skies just above. It wasn't until many villages had been awakened that the Solar Sailors caught the first signals of life on the planet, and started again to look closely. Communicating through the dreams of Adani on the planet surface that could hear them, they started to guide them toward Ajeiajeia. But, inadvertanly, this led the Scribes to it, first. Thus, it was the Scribes who mastered development of the Solar Sails again, and harvest of previous materials that could be used for Scribal Prime's purposes.*
*In here now the idea of Scribes plural must be known, for in Scribal Prime's tactics, the elevation of a select group of Adani from the villages as a guild of prestige and order-keepers was instrumental, thus Scribes were brought up from the intellectual, and the cruel, to study at Dark Mountain and learn the crafts that warped Echo could teach them. Through its cunning understandings of the Adanic mind, it wove a web of grandoise and ceremony round those first acolytes, and instilled in them a spirit of unshakable control in its name. They were instructed never to tell another soul of its true nature, being an Echo, and thus when the next generation of Scribes would come up, they were trained by that inner circle, and not Scribal Prime directly, enforcing mystique and mystery; one Scribe at a time would be selected from the Scribes in coming years to learn the secret of Scribal Prime's true nature, and not another until that Scribe had perished.*

*Before the Solar Sailors fell from the skies, then, the Scribes could have formed a great network of connection across the desert, reaching Ajeiajeia first, establishing operations across it, harvesting its water, and perhaps setting sight on relocating there. Or perhaps it is the very act of them reaching Ajeiajeia, and the Solar Sailors seeing this from above, or learning about this in dreams, that spurs them to accelerate their activities, and speed themselves down there. Scribal claims and allegiance could be upon several of the settlements that Silver, Aji, and the survivors are traveling through, which could add a sense of danger to their travels up-river where the narrative currently holds no conflict. Excellent. Then, it can be that the Twelve Sailors reached the valley below the Holy Mountain before the Scribes could reach it, and claimed it for their own, winning the hearts of many Adani seeking freedom from the Scribes, and so it is an uneasy environment on the brink of conflict that Silver, Aji, and the survivors reach, preparing for conflict with the Scribes and the people they control. But who could actually believe in the lies of Scribal Prime at this point but the brainwashed? Many then shake free from the yoke, and two nations on the river form, since actual fighting is not favorable, but conflict of mind, conflict of belief, misalignment of values and directions, becomes the true battle between these peoples. Thus it is even an act of great conflict for Silver to found an Academy on the Southern Grasslands... And there's the matter of the Temple of Rebirth. So the saga that bears these two locations onto the Southern Grasslands will need some sort of battle, since the Scribes hold Cataract, but travel right beside the Temple of Rebirth on their way.*

*And of course... how is there a Temple of Rebirth if there is no Truegold? Every Vault had a small reserve, enough to allow every Adani one single life more, if they chose to have it. Thus, their reserve of Truegold, in the form of a pressed coin around their necks, was vaulted in the Temple of Rebirth founded by the Thirteen Sailors in a valley just east of Aja, in the nearest foothill to the Holy Mountain. That is, the coins not stolen by the Scribes, and vaulted instead with Scribal Prime in Dark Mountain...*

*Very few Adani under control of the Scribes were granted second life, and they only on condition that their fealty remained forevermore with Scribal Prime.*

*Thus it was on that fateful night when the Sailors fell from the skies that those Adani who had been speaking with them during sleep were at work convincing their fellow villagers, in secret, to depart from Scribal control in the night with Holy Mountain as their destination. Secret caves and the paths leading to them were revealed by the Sailors, where they all would convene and begin a new nation in strength with each other. It wasn't until a great number had already gathered that the Sailors began to fall from the sky. They did not all fall on the same night, but fell on different days, across several years, to guide the trusting survivors through Scribal revenge, and the dangers of that scorched planet. We can say then that Ani's village was in a high state of oppression by the time Silver, the last Sailor in the sky, finally fell there to help free them all. At this of course, Scribal Prime gained its greatest asset: an Echo to use as a bargaining chip, and extract information from. But Silver was an ancient Echo, made by the greatest Scribes in the zenith of their craft, and his freedom was inevitably won, despite Scribal Prime's smokescreen of mystery, and control of the Scribes at Dark Mountain, Silver was able to escape with Ani; this was no trivial matter, however, and they had to steal a Sandglider.*

*A lot of the story beats are changing right now, and I think that's perfectly okay. Let's do a synopsis timeline here:*

- Scribes awaken, discover their inevitable doom, make Scribal Prime.
- Scribal Prime awakens Adani, controls them, and inevitably reaches Ajeiajeia.
- Thirteen Echoes in the sky communicate with awakened Adani, orchestrate a rebellion with its center in the caves beneath Holy Mountain.
- Silver, the last Sailor in the sky, descends to the earth and tries to reach Ani to lead his village to Holy Mountain, but is captured by the Scribes.
- Ani is taken to Dark Mountain, unites with Silver, and they both escape.
- The Scribes lead an assault on Ani's village; his people escape, take refuge in the desert, and unite many villagers in a plan to reach Holy Mountain. The survivors are discovered, and flee in the night.
- Silver, Aji, and the survivors reach Holy Mountain. Enough Adani exist to form a nation, with Aja as its capitol. An uneasy treatise stands between the Adani who are Echo-aligned, versus those who are Scribe-controlled.
