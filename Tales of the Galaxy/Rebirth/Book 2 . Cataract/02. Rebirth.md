The first and most important step in preparation for being preserved into a Chamber of Rebirth is full assimilation of Truegold into the body that will undergo preservation. This requires many baths in purest Truegold solution across several months, until the solution finally sets. The skin becomes radiant and golden over this process. It cannot be performed after a person has died, and one who dies midway through this process is not saved from departure of the mortal coil. The Living Adani, haing cured in TrueGold completely, will, at some point, undergo a rapid transformation, where the gold becomes a poison in their body, and begins to sap their life away. This is an incredibly dangerous moment in the process; at this exact time, the Adani must enter the brine, not before and not long after. This marks the final moments of that Adani's life, and it is into that brine where they must die, in order later to be reborn. Every steopp in the process myst be performed precisely, lest the Spirit be ost to the cosmic winds.

An Echo discovered this power, long ago before the world was burned. Though the math was perfect, the first few Adani to try it were lost, and the Echo nearly paid for that malpractice with their eternal life.
