Silver leads the sand sailors on a many-moons ride across a vast desert. 

Transition: They behold the Southern Grasslands.

Onto the lands beyond the desert, that vast and endless desert of which so few people have travelled, following compass that the Sailor kept, pointing toward the meeting place of the other Sailors, we now turned our gaze, as the Scribes burned the world around us and tried to do the same to our Academy. We escaped, but only narrowly.

"Only a little farther," he called to the party, many moons after setting out on this massive trek, where water and food were too scarce, but a barge was constructed bearing provisions and supplies for this crew to survive the long journeym though that was coming into question. "QWe cannot eat sunlight as you can, great Sailor."

So we traveled on the promise of a metal man, beyond hope and into imminent death, to unite with the promised family who lived beyond the sky.

But as we drew closer, we all began to dream the same dream: white hallowed halls in tall rock, with water flowing everywhere, trickling on marble and echoing sweet music across polished stone.

Deep into the heart of a massive alley we entered, following a deep cut of dry riverbed, farther onward, toward a holy river that flowed across all the years of darkness and desert, supplied by the waters flowing out of a 
## mighty river-making mountain.
