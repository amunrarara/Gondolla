> Here is a tale that I have poured a great part of my soul upon.

>Most of the contents of this story are within my journals, annotated with *Vista Prime* in the title. The work began while I lived in Seattle, ~2017. I will have to discover where the material is from that day; it likely resides in a journal of paper that must be digitized. A bulk of the work here, thus far, was performed in ~2018 and onward.

>These tales are the foundations of the Beings I had later named *The Echoes*; the Metal Men, the robotic lifeforms which traverse Gondōlla on missions of their own design, undergoing their own tales, transformations, travesties. 
>
>In *Vista Prime*, such a Tribe of Echoes dwells upon a city in the clouds of a far-off planet, isolated from the greater galaxy of Echoes, engaged in acts which could be deemed immediately as "utterly fucking pointless". I had undergone numerous directions of thought regarding this planet, the source and nature of its isolation, the characters within it, and the forces-at-play within that city. I typically rested upon a single main character, *Ra*, sometimes called *RAM*.

>*Vista Prime* was first called *Data Crash*, and in fact was my first attempt at finding a home for this awesome concept: **losing touch with one's history in in the post-Information Age**. The concept carried over, of course, throughout Gondōlla, and can be seen then cropping up in the stories of just about every computer-using peoples in my stories.

>The stories of Ra encapsulate a few possible threads, of which neither has been fully settled as the definitive course. I looked to the Roaring 20s for inspiration, for a time, and placed the whole of robotic society on that planet in a sort of endless stasis of control, forced to play a game and sacrifice their lives toward the pursuit of *zaps*, units of energy which they must exchange for physical charge to remain alive. There of course was a thread where I considered Vista Prime to be a research facility utilized by some sort of post-apocalyptic scientists who sent the Echoes across the galaxy and utilize them as a sort of avatar program. All interesting threads, but I believe the one I'm most excited for is tying Vista Prime together with my Echo myths within Gondōlla, as a sort of breakaway place where the Echoes have lost touch with others beyond the reach of their planet, and entered into a sort of collective insanity, within which only a few begin to awaken to a remembrance of their true history.

>The story made its way into ideas for a comic series, an animated cartoon, a VR videogame to give the player a sensation of being a robot, and more. 
>
>There's all sorts of interesting threads to that story, which anyone may discover by reading through the journal entries annotated with *- Vista Prime*.

>Someday, hopefully, I shall complete that work, Inshallah.
