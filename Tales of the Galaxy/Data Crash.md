*This very phrase, Data Crash, has been part of my written works since about 2016. The phrase has been used throughout my stories to, essentially, indicate the same thing: A moment in time when a world loses contact with its data. Unable to access its records, the world descends through an event known as a Data Crash, which in my stories is oft the catalyst for the dawn of a new Age.*

*Due to the fact that many of my stories bear reference to a Data Crash, it is difficult to pinpoint one thread which I would definitely state is THE Data Crash story thread. At a time, it belonged to RAM, the Echo who was born one day upon Vista Prime, in The Factory at the heart of the city; later, it belonged to the inhabitants of The Star Glass tales, which has taken many forms in itself.*

*At that time of inception, 2016, I was living in the Capitol Hill / First Hill district of Seattle, studying computer science, and trying to keep hold of my sanity; a harrowing feat, at the time. I was beginning a long arc which would inevitably create output of a whole new kind into Gond≈çlla: the tales of The Echoes were conceived at that time, and I found my imagination constantly attempting to fit the hard sciences into my mythology. Maddening, the phenomena, attempting to incorporate another form of truth which did not, at the time, fit together in mind nor heart. I can thank my stories for many things, but chief among them is giving a playground to both myth and science, in dance which may upset some, yet may inspire others to new heights yet-unimagined.*
