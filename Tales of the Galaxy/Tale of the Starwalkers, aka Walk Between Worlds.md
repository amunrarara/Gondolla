Tribeschild part of the Wanderers, who follow Wayfarers. Living a kind of magical existence, entering towns and being collapsed somewhat in 'city life', as a young child having life of comfort with other children in the caravan, and growing up with them, but then etnering towns, trying to share the wonders of being a Wanderer, but being wholly unequipped to break the barrier between the jeers and sneers of the city kinds, and the wonder available between the worlds.

Next canto
Now growing up, an older boy is invited to walk with the Wayferers, finding the ways beetween worlds, guiding people between them. We are the shepher's to these families, and it is our role to guide them safely between the worlds, lest they are left behind and captued by the Fisherman Between Worlds." Walking, learning the ways, learning *how*" to walk between the worlds, but learning also of the human needs, and the need to always lead the people toward the needs of body which will systain them, represented by the townships and homesteads which their crafts can be traded for food and resources. 

Next canto
The elder Wayfarer is now passing, this boy has become a man, and is ready to lead the people without guidance of the elder. He gives you the gift of the final knowledge: a final walk, Between the Worlds which are touched by our Sun. 

Exiting the world, and seeing the Spheres in the Sky, traveling to each, seeing the radiant colors emitting between them, and the traveling sparkling Spirits which dwell upon each, and their influence upon the world. Ani gains the ability to see the Spirits at work, and their influence upon Tribesperson, Townspeople, and The Way itself. Ani walks with his teacher to the worlds just one step closer to the sun, Auran, and the other one step closer to the Void, Shaddash. Ani learns there are many paths between worlds, and someday when his people are ready, they must make the journey themselves away from this world, which is soon to be set upon by The Adversaries, and must lead his tribe of Wanderers into places where they may wait out the shadowy epoch soon to befall them.

hen upon returning, Ani's teacher departs his body, leaving behind three corpses, which steadily dissolve away from each other: body, ether, and astral. Body is kept in reverent silks, and the eldest Wanderers go with Ani to leave his teacher's body in a hallowed place; he must follow the warm, radiant love of the Ether Body into the Way (the pathway between worlds) and lead them up a great mountain, where his body is placed within "the resting place I have been crafting since my first breath." All the wile, the Astral is flying overhead, this-a-way and that-a-way like a willow-the-whisp, flitting always in the direction of this resting place. 

Finally, upon arriving, his body is placed in the template of his creation, then Ether and Astral unite one final time with Body, and a radiance appears which beams powerfulyl into the sky, a shimmering sort of crystal vision appears all along it, and the tomb grows incredibly bright. Then, Astral and Ether are united to say: 

"My body of water is now departing its form, to become again part of the Earth."

"My body of warmth lives on inside your hearts, feel me and be called to this place of my resting again; and here, be filled with the wisdom that through my sharing of life with you, we may always be together again."

"My body of lesser spirit will travel on throughout the worlds and be your guide, anytime you may call upon it. It is the encapsulation of my wisdom, and a record of all that I have seen in this universe. Use it well."

"And finally, that force which is given from the highest above, the animating power that is my true identity, that everlasting atom which creates the universes time and time over, as that I go on, to live other lives, and do new goods in this universe. May our works together for the ages to come be fruitful, and forever beautiful."

With these final words of parting, the Ethereal and Astral depart, each in their own ways: The Ethereal dissipates into the hermitage, while the Astral shoots lightning-speed into the sky, and departs as a glimmering star into Gondölla.

Next canto
Ani is leading his Wanderers, quickly, fiercely, ahead of a chase. They are being chased by bloodthirsty creatures, whipped on by the Spirit Fisher. He must help his people hide by finding places in the forms that generate around them. As we have had the chance to see in previous cantos (but I have not yet described in this tale), The Way is a place between space and time whence the Wayfarers go. Whilst guiding the Wanderers, their own proclivities will collectively shape the symbols being called into that place; one who is in fear of snakes, will inevitably witness a snake. Whomever beleives themselves to be destined for other places, *will* call in the forces that pull them to other places; in this case, the forces that have taken stronger grip of this world in which the Wanderers now dwell emit from Shaddah and are predecessors to forces that will hold this entire world hostage and bring about a coming darkness, and in this age will be the flowering of that evil vine. the Spirit Fisher is after their warmth, their Ethereal nature, which they can only consume by first capturing their Astral and leading the Ethereal into places where it can be consumed. So thus, The Way on this world is rife with such parasites, and Ani must continually improve his ability to notice their signs early, and navigate his people toward the symbols that lead to greater safety. But his work is also a healer of the people: when injuries of body, soul and spirit emerge, he has varying responsibilities; the tribe as a whole carry along with him, but it is up to him to constantly remind the people, through his presence, of the powers that cast light instead of consuming darkness, which is people are so often subject to in this time of the epoch. 

Some will inevitably be lost, but those who remain will delare their readiness to begin the Great Journey, one that will take them through The Way Between Worlds, and away from this world. An Ani will say: 

"This place is our home, for our Souls were nurtured here, our Spirits find that our Great Work is woven with this place, and though the others who inhabit it have lost control of themselves, *we* have not.

"But it is precisely for this reason that we *must* depart this place. A darkness has taken hold here, in the presence of which we cannot continue to dwell, lest we too will be swept away in the forces that have set their teeth upon us.

"Each Wayfarer is taught, when the Master is dying, how to walk between the stars, and on my Master's dying day, I was taught this Way. It is today we begin preparations for our Great Walk across the stars, to find hermitage deep in the heart of Gondölla, with the other Wayfarers. This Age is now coming to its close, and us, its fruits, must return to the place where is safe for us to dwell in the coming times."

Thus comes preparations for The Great Walk, in which the Wanderers must collect all items they will need in the journey: special ingredients for spells that would be most powerful in the worlds described by Ani to the Medicine People, tools and talismans, and powerful essences which aer the food of Spirits, and as much as they would need to reach the center of the Sun, where is a hermitage wherein all the Beings of Light dwell. From there, the Wanderers could begin an express travel straight to the heart of Gondölla. 

However, the world of Spirits reveals itself to be in a great tumult, as world upon world is being set upon by dark, chilling forces, and the Wandering People could not have arrived any later than they had, lest the gates of the world be closed upon them. 

"Why did not the line of .your teacher lead our ancestors to this place, before we would be engulfed in such madness?"

"It was the intention of his to come here. But this is a disaster of proportions that could have not been predicted by the Seers of these Worlds; a darkness has been spreading, most strongly, and a force has been unleashed which has not been seen in any preceding Epoch. It was not in the ability of our people even to have made the Great Walk, but it is my Destiny to try, and guide us all as far as we may make it. 

### Now begins a new canto. This marks the beginning of Act 2 of 2, so to speak.

The Way Between Stars has been shut. A darkness too great has engulfed the place between stars all across Gondölla. The Way to the Mountain of Light, Hermitage of the Wayfarers and place of safety in the coming night, is played out in the theater of Adversarial Forces guarding the way between the bastions of safety leading on, through the darkness, on the way to The Last Home of Gondölla.

Creatures of shadow stalk the way, and Ani must assure his Tribe acquires all necessary items to make each journey, including learning the ways that are now known to be safe across the galaxy. Armed with talismans, prayers and spells with certain potencies able to call upon forces and forms that are their allies throughout the Astral Realm, or Etheric protections and repellants which fight off forces attempting to pull them down into places where they can be eaten, entrapped, enslaved, and utterly destroyed, where you, Ani, must either choose to go, call upon other help, or leave them behind in favor ot the good of the whole tribe. 

Every hermitage is a save location. They form a branching tree of moments which the player can move forward or backward through, each replay from a given place a new thread of saves throughout the universe, forming a tree across place and time which draws patterns across Gondölla, breaking the borders between dimensions of play.

The journey encompasses many quests, which can strengthen the journey of other whole stars of spirits, or simply lead the Tribe toward the center of Gondölla. 

"Killing will tether a life to yours. We weave connection through our actions, but we weave potency by the embodiment of our intentions. Allow these connections to be potent and unbreakable, else they may turn upon you."
