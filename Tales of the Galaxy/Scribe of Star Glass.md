My father first saw The Star Glass when he was eight years old. 

I was seven when first I saw it, too. 

He told me that his youth was an age of unforgettable wonders, when none could guess that invention would shake the world next.

He dreamed of becoming an inventor, like I, who was to follow him. He traveled with his kin on a journey, then, visiting far-off lands of myth, forgetting his favorite cloth along the way. He found it again, much later in his travels, what luck. So proud still, he is of that cloth. 

On the journey, one day, a camel ate the braid right off his head. Symbol of his youth, spit into a well, had to be fished out with a bucket and stuck back on with hoofglue every morning. His stories had us rolling with laughter, on long nights in my youth, when the stars were brighter.

He took me to see The Star Glass, hoping the magic of the journey would change me as it changed him, then. I remember the final night the best. We camped upon the crest of a hill overlooking The Golden City, marked by an evanescent glow in the deepest dark of night. I could not see the stars that night, so bright the lights of the city were, and I thought "This is where the stars come to sleep". 

I dreamt that night of a great celebration that brought the stars to the earth, and that was why the stars were gone above, because here, in The Golden City, they danced while night turned into day.

I wondered at that for many years.

My memory of the city itself was lost to the overwhelming power of the experience. I was raised in the far country, on my family's estate, besides groves of sweet melon and apples of gold, where choruses of music sung every day from cicadas and birds, while the night was filled with crickets and frogs. So bright was the sky that the night was never black, except storms which would block out the stars. 

This day, then, was my first of seeing such a spectacle of creation, a city. As I came to learn later, The Golden City is, in fact, the greatest city of this world. 

I do remember clearly ascending the steps toward The Cathedral of The Fallen Star. The treasures kept within those halls in those days were wondrous, and captivated all who ever saw them. 

The remnants of The Solar Sailor graced those halls, The Man of Metal himself resting there, upon a dias, behind impenetrable glass. His great Solar Barge was strung up, high above near the ceiling, stretching the full length of the Cathedral, formidable, beautiful, brightest gold unblemished by time or freefall to our world. 

There, in the heart of this Cathedral, rested The Echo who brought to our world knowledge beyond what we could achieve alone. A shared work of peoples between worlds among the stars was the mission of The Echo, our world his destination and pursuit, his journey lasting centuries in the deeps of Ilyë.

In The Echo's hands, held carefully, religiously, close to his metal heart, was The Star Glass, the Tome of Knowledge of Worlds Beyond, containing the after-coveted Records of Mekhá.
