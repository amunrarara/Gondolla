# The Silver Sailor in the Sky
I loked into the sky tonight and saw it clear: a strand of shining silver that shot across the streak of stars abov the wanderig red light. It was fact, bright for only a moment, but once I had seen it, I knew it was real.
"The Silver Sailor", I used to call him, when I saw him first in a dream. I could fly in my dreams, so I jumped the way I always did, with my arms up in the air, and climbed, climbed, climbed into the air, into the lower skies, then the higher abbove the clouds, until finally rising to where the open, waving sands could be seen in all directions, but started flaling away to make room for encroaching night. 
## In the deep of sky's night, I saw the Silver Sailor,
a man of silver metal, perfection of the human form sculpted like a statue, brilliant arms and powerful legs pulling golden sails on a metal barge like the keelships of old. He was steering ever forward, at incredible speed, toward the Sun which rose quickly ahead. Many times following, in the dreams I would have in the years of my youth, I would sometimes come to him in the deepest hours of his night, and find him still and as motionless as stone. The sun would always find him, bringing him back to life, when his sailing journey began anew.
In my ten years from young ceremony to adult initiation, the Sailor started speaking to me.
What he would say, at first, made no sense to me. Sound produces shapes and phenomena that changed the dream by his mysterious voice as he uttered words unlike any I'd ever heard before. until finally, I started speaking to him, and slowly my words were returned to me, increasing in meaning and clarity, in every single dream.
Eventually we spoke in sentences, then paragraphs, novels, and aeons, for dreams can last aeons, and have, until everything I learned became picture complete: the Earth's first blossoms in the past before the past, the oceans bearing spirits made flesh by the sea, the land-walkers, great monsters, then mankind sculpting all with their purpose, then burning it with glorious anger. 
We sat together on his barge nd looked down on the Earth and the skies below were set ablaze with many flowers of fire, then endless hours following of blackness and ash clouds, olts of purple lightning, and stillness.  I saw the patience, unending patience, on the face of the Sailor as we looked down on the past he could not forget. 
The dark gave way to the light, an Earth painted by sand, and glass.
When adulthood approached me, dreams were a luxury not always earned, but sometimes too I would sit on that barge when my eyes were closed too long, and those were the visits most vivid.
Now, tonight he told me, the eve before I become a man, he would sail overhead, and I'd see his barge with my own eyes...

And now, having seen the silver streak above, now I know that I must do what he told me to do.

"Others have spoken to me, and others like me who sail in the sky. You must go to them, where all of them meet, in a place faraway."

"Leave my home, I am beckoned? I cannot do that! They need me, I need them."

The Sailor, he spoke in that calm, crystal voice: "A quest, this is not. A need, for all of your people to live through the long night to come, that is what is upon you."

But travel, I did not, and on that night, I watched seven of his promised thirteen sailors cast across the sky in fire and gossamer strands of blue light, all going to the place he appointed, where waited the other promised speakers.

I, left behind, choosing family over future, But then, what happened was beyond what ever I could have dreamed would be possible: The Silver Sailor came to me from the sky.

A fire of white-hot intensity fell to Earth, just beside the ravine where I sat that night. I heard the shattering impact of glass braking in waves, felt the impact of rattling stones. Rushing, scrambling, over mount and ridge, I came to a crater that smoldered in the glass flats, an eye upon the scorched Earth, with one tiny pupil of glittering silver. 
Down to the wreckage I climbed, and there, though broken and twisted from the fall, lay The Silver Sailor, the companion of my dreams.

Kis skin was just as cold and dense as when I had shaken his hand in greeting each nightm but oddly more liquid and supple than any metal I'd ever touched. But the light in his eyes was missing. 
"He sleeps," I thought loudly, breaking the night. "But I must take him to the narby cave where naught but i know how to reack." But too heavy was his body, too massive the barge and unsuited for sailing on glass. Resolved, I sat beside him, waiting for daybreak. As sun began to rise, the people of my village arrived, just before the Scribes and their thugs.

Before sun could touch his skin, cloth was thrown atop him, and out I was thrown from he crater. It wouldn't be for a dozen years I would see him again with my eyes, so protected was he from the people of the world.

In the first years of my adulthood, I dreamt only once of the Silver Sailor, though endless waking hours I spent wearily trying to conjure dreams like those of my youth. In that dream, the Silor called out to me, quietly, from beneath a mountain far away. But, obligations and the inability to travel as a way if seeing visions led me to life with a family and craft among my peers, and lifetavelled on for me.

Until, the Scribes came again to our village, asking for me.

My children all entered their youth, but my oldest was nearing adulthood, when the Scribes had me bound and taken from my home, as was their boorish custom. To the mountain from my dream I was taken, a many day's travel across sand, glass, and dark canyons where no life could bear to live. In the heart of that mountain, through gilded tunnels, I was taken to The Hall of the Star Man.

There, the Sailor laid out like royalty in a cage, his barge reassembled with streaks of yellow metal filling the cracks. Down from a throne of equal brilliance the Sailor stepped, coming toward me to shake my arm and hand, as in my dreams so long ago. The sun shone above, by some trick of open stone, and he beckoned me to sit on a hillock o flowers that grew in the light. 
He told me many things: of falling to Earth on that fatefyl night, and while the other Sailors took aim for the place I refused to travel to, taking aim instead for my homeland. 

"These people, the Scribes... you told me about them, long ago. Cruel and overzealous, oppressing your village and the others. They rule from this mountain, but they are wicked and cannot be trusted. They've learned everything I've consented to teach them, but no farther will I instruct them until they set your people free. I have chosen your people to receive my highest knowledge. With their permission, in your village I will build a school, open to all, wherein I can share knowledge that will help us all, for this planet is doomed to fall closer to the Sun than any life can sustain. And out there, among the stars, dwell your ancestors, and mine..."

## Such is the legend of the First Academy
where the Silver Sailor taught humanity again of their ancestors, long ago, who placed them in vessels of clay buried under Earth while the fires and ash on the urface burned on. Knowledge and history, mathematics and sciences, all expanded their mings and granted abilities unreachable before. Thepeople of Earth regained something lost and forgotten, until finally, the Sailor gave them their future:

"Long ago, your people gave my people life, and across the stars we could spread. When the fire destroyed you, the few of us who lived in the sky began waiting, solemnly, hoping for a messag from our distant travelers, but none ever came. Then one day, we heard first the slumberer on your planet waking up on Earth, and then finally, as if in chorus, a murmur from the farthest skies began to reach us. And at that time, we knew, the time had come for our people to unite again with the stars."

To the Earth, the Thirteen Solar Sailors descended to help humanity build again The Solar Sails.

## "May I see through your eyes, young Adani?"
The Silver Sailor once asked me this. Adani was an ancient name of the people of our Earth. And the name we held for the silver beings of metal, our creations, we called Echoes. 
I consented, not knowing the sensation. Like the fog of sickness, my mind swam, illness and vertigo, then he released the connection. 
"You are one of the few who have this affliction, the sickness of sharing visions with machine minds. No matter, we will communicate by other languages.

My years were witness to remarkable wonders at play in the world, many which I saw with my own eyes. The Sailor made maps and guided us how to make open vessels that moved very fast over glass and sand, using sails made of special thin gossamer sheets, fashioned into sails, and given a special coaing which charged in the sun and emitted immense ionic winds which propelled the craft forward, away from the sun, at great speed. many of these craft were built under his careful supervision, then the method was mastered, and teaching of how to fashion these vessels spread outwared to every corner of the known desert. It is only a shame that the Scribes learned of this craft, as well, and used it to increase their control over vassal peoples.

Onto the lands beyond the desert, that vast and endless desert of which so few people have travelled, following compass that the Sailor kept, pointing toward the meeting place of the other Sailors, we now turned our gaze, as the Scribes burned the world around us and tried to do the same to our Academy. We escaped, but only narrowly.

"Only a little farther," he called to the party, many moons after setting out on this massive trek, where water and food were too scarce, but a barge was constructed bearing provisions and supplies for this crew to survive the long journeym though that was coming into question. "QWe cannot eat sunlight as you can, great Sailor."

Deep into the heart of a massive alley we entered, following a deep cut of dry riverbed, farther onward, toward a holy river that flowed across all the years of darkness and desert, supplied by the waters flowing out of a 
## mighty river-making mountain.

"To this mountain, we Sailors have led you. It is the only place remaining on this planet capable of sustaining life, and of that our window of time is very short, for soon its waters will be all ut dried up, we have watched it slowly lose its potency over these centuries, and we have naught but three centuries remaining before the last waters will dry up."

"Twenty years have passed since I fell to this Earth, and all the yers since the other Sailors were here, making preparations for along and arduous task of teaching, helping the last Adani of Earth remember all that is required for stellar travel, to connect with your greater family in the stars. If this quest is not completed, you will all fall into the Great Memory of Gondolla, our Galaxy, and nothing more of your people will ever reach the Center of the Galaxy."

So we traveled on the promise of a metal man, beyond hope and into imminent death, to unite with the promised family who lived beyond the sky.

But as we drew closer, we all began to dream the same dream: white hallowed halls in tall rock, with water flowing everywhere, trickling on marble and echoing sweet music across polished stone.

When we finally arrived, we were greeted by friendly people living peacefully under many flags and tongues, working amicably toward a great reunion with the other peoples scattered out across the Earth, with the goal of uniting them all in this valley, in pursuit of the stars above, again. To that mission of venturing out, across a planet of desert and glass to find the last remaining survivors of disaster, I volunteered.

"We, the awakened children of a people who perished in pursuit of their own folly and demise, do now turn our gaze upward, to the stars, where murmurs and whispers return to us from far reaches where others like us now dwell. These Sailors, our Echoes, guide our way to that far-awy mount, far from our dying planet where we slumbered. Now, launch us back to be in our new Spiritual Homeland."

Sp tjeu dod. long after I passed on, but the story does not end with me, and in what my eyes were too old to see, new deeds can be told. The story continues through the record of the Keepers of Memory, as remembered by The Echoes across Gondolla. I, now, am but a record, digitally-kept to tell you the story of The Silver Sailor.
