# Gondﾅ考la
## A Galactic Spiritual Mythology

## *Hearken ye, Spirit who Walks Between the Worlds!*

### What is Gondﾅ考la?
The name *Gondﾅ考la* is given to the first Galaxy, a primordial region wherein the deeds of ancient peoples capable of *walking between the worlds* allowed travel between the stars through means driven by Spiritual capacities, available within all who chose to develop them. 

Science nerds, relent; this is, uncompromisingly, a Spiritual-Science Fantasy.

This website contains the work-in-progress story, with supporting materials, which has been part of my life's work now for greater than a decade. It is the in-transformation tale from many-numbered journal entries, splinters of tales, pieces and bits, characters who show their faces in many different lives and lifetimes, languages, cosmological ideas, Spiritual ideals, videogame ideas, and much, much more. 

Due to the nature of my mind, I find it necessary to release my work as-is, and allow the Reader (that's you) to embark upon the journey with me, as I bring this story from its seminal form, into a more-complete corpus of completion.

I hope you enjoy reading it as thoroughly as I have creating it. Please mind the mess.
