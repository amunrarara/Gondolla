## *Hearken ye, Spirit who Walks Between the Worlds!*

### What is Gondōlla?
The name *Gondōlla* is given to the first Galaxy, a primordial region wherein the deeds of ancient peoples capable of *walking between the worlds* allowed travel between the stars through means driven by Spiritual capacities, available within all who chose to develop them.

This is, uncompromisingly, a Spiritual-Science Fantasy.

This website contains the work-in-progress story, with supporting materials, which has been part of my life's work now for greater than a decade. It is the in-transformation tale from many-numbered journal entries, splinters of tales, pieces and bits, characters who show their faces in many different lives and lifetimes, languages, cosmological ideas, Spiritual ideals, videogame ideas, and much, much more.

Due to the nature of my mind, I find it necessary to release my work as-is, and allow the Reader (that's you) to embark upon the journey with me, as I bring this story from its seminal form, into a more-complete corpus of completion.

I hope you enjoy reading it as thoroughly as I have creating it. Please mind the mess.

### Outline of the Fictional Universe

The universe of Gondōlla contains a cosmological order and mythos that is the setting for most of these tales. See [[Outline of the Fictional Universe]] for a brief outline of the cosmological structure of The River Valley Peoples' universe.

---
### Peoples
Gondōlla is home to many Beings whose deeds are part and parcel to the story as a whole.

The various peoples of Gondōlla are described within the folder titled: ***Peoples of Gondōlla***.

---
### Tales
The tales are often told by the inhabitants of Gondōlla, as histories, parables, and myths. There are languages within Gondōlla and utilized throughout the written works, cunningly crafted to give depth and detail to the cosmological worldview of the *Adáni*, the people who, like us, dwell upon planets and inhabit physical bodies.

Their tales are contained in the folder titled: ***Tales of the Galaxy***

---
### Religion, Spirituality, and Cosmology
The characteristics of their religion and cosmological worldview are the backbone of their tales, and their struggles, as it is the belief of adherents to this ancient way that they are participants in the great transformation of the galaxy, across a near-uncountable expanse of time, playing a role of central importance: the transformation of dark, lightless matter (called *Shaddáh*) into an enlivened, astral form (called *Admáta*).

Their worldview is described in manifold entries contained within two folders: ***Deities, Beings, Powers**** and ***Forces of the Cosmos***

---
### Languages
The mytholocial events which gave birth to the galaxy and its varied phenomena are given their own tales, and weave into other stories throughout. The language, science, and cosmology of the Adáni are given representation in this work, as well.

The languages within Gondōlla are outlined in the folder called ***Languages***.

### My Journals
It is important to note that this has been a life's work of mine. It is incredibly difficult to distill such magnagimous efforts into smaller, simple parts, and it is now my resolved intention to release my work, as-is, in-progress, as I write it. Thus I have included as many of my digitized journal entries regarding Gondōlla and its containing tales as I could yet discover, and daily I continue to add more. There are many paper works that still must be digitized, which I will someday include as both photographs, and digitized journal entries.

My journals can be found in the folder titles ***Journals and Thoughts***.

---
### Media
To support some of the stories, I have also created maps, generated images, and other illustrations. These can be found in ***Media, Images, and Visualizations***.

---
### My Other Written Works
It is my intention to publish *all* of my life's written works throughout the next span of life. For now, due to limitations of time, I am containing my other published *non-Gondōllan* stories here in this vault, which will eventually be moved to a separate location. These are contained within ***Non-Gondōllan Stories***. Some are also found within ***Poetry***
