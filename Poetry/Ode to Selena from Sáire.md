O Selena, my Dearest Sister,
Long have you searched for me,
Though wretched was I. 

Fallen to the Darkness,
I was lost from Light. 

My heart grew cold, 
My mind was twisted,
My actions were sinister.

Sacrifice you made
To bring be back home.

Broken into beautiful pieces,
Forever remembered in glass and gossamer.

O the Deceiver who crafted this Darkness,
Liar and stealer of so much life,
You told me I would be Lord of this Land,
That objects of mind would be whole and my own,
That Darkness, where Nothing reigned, could be shaped 
To creations, designs, incredible works,
That Life could be left to roam free here, 
To grow as I pleased, or Commanded it so.

Lost, was I then, to think there is greater than 
Sharing my Dance with the others,
That in my design there could be perfection
When Nothing and only my own thoughts would craft
That perfect, untainted, and wholly my own
A world could be born from the Flame in my Heart.

Your lie that perfection unmatched 
Is only for those who
Separate,
Isolate, and
Propagate
Their mind
Untouched.

From Bosom of All to this Barren of Naught
You led us into your thrall.

I see now your Light coming towards me, Selena,
I reach out my arm to hold you again.

Wherever you have been, I will return there,
Wherever you will go, I will follow.

What life I could steal back from Míro is yours,

Lost in Míraj I am not, anymore, 
This capital in Darkness holds Naught but my memory.
It will not claim my Admáta, too.

In service to breaking this ship of Míro's evil,
Taking us all so far from our homes, 
I offer my heart in service to the Light.

May others escape this dark place,
May others remember what it means to be alive.

Our Spirits' Atoms will shine
Through the regions of Darkness 
We will light up this space
With unwavering power.

Upon my back, build a bridge back to Aéia, 
May all who have lost their way walk it.
