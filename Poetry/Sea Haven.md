How can I say that all is truly well?
my life, my love, my home, my hearth,

I have sailed through such storms 
that would shatter the stainless glass of delicate hearts,
and watched my brethren sink forever beneath the seas,
laden with pains that are armor for their egos, and death to their souls,
and I have lost myself in those waters, roiling with turmoil, looking for them, 
thinking it is I who has drowned them,
but how do I rescue who will not choose to swim,
who would rather sink with their coffers full of naught?

Now in this hour of sunlight, I have sailed to safe harbours,
being lost at the sea for these centuries,
here, I say, I will build my heart a home,
I will sow from these seeds I have kept
on a necklace since the sunrise of storms,
and make magic from the branches that bear their fruits,
and now, in this sanctum, I am happy.

Many have come to this harbour, to rest and to dance beneath the apple blossom trees,
and I greet them with love, and I share of my gifts,
but I know that they will not want to stay very long,
for so many have come when they seek to ride high on the waves,
to dance in the rain and shout with the thunder, and think I will do the same,
and at times I will join, flying high in the skies, and for a moment, maybe more, 
I will be again wild and free in the way that they know,
but always, I return, to my home, to my hearth,
where await my books of Elvish, and my simple little ways,
which are slow for many people, for they do not like to wait, 
and my hourglass reminds them of the flaws of our fathers,
or my books do not smell like their sweet flower-crowns,
and the stories that litter my walls and tables, few shall care to read,
or the tales I will tell them at the rising of the moon, few shall care to hear,
yet I love them all the while, for I know them so well, 
having danced with them beneath the apple blossom trees,
they do not know the journeys that await the mind unbound,
the joys that surpass for me the excitement of the sea,
and they do not see the stillness, 
and the silence that I cultivate,
is but a doorway to my treasures,
and my making of this harbour, this simple little place,
is the glory of my greatest hour.

I await their return, but do not turn the hourglass, 
for there are few things that such a tool can measure.
