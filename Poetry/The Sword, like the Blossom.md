Where the Sword when held
By a Knight in pursuit of the inner Grail
The vessel of Bliss, the cup of Devachan,
Was an instrument of sacrifice, a device of renunciation,
A symbol incarnate in metal,
Sought and used in pursuit of highest human attainment,
To wield it, the Knight must renounce,
To transform those beasts on their journey in Kamaloka,
To sacrifice and stream outward the gold that was given to them.
To hold the sword was to adopt the living path.

Yet the sword, the symbol of death given,
Like the blossom of fire which we've taken from Arihman,
Stealing a little of the lowest realms
of that evil mirror to Devachan,
Like that blossom which in the bosom of Nature makes the flowers bloom
and the sun's warmth stream unto Earth,
The sword can be handed to the beast when the soul has not renounced,
When the soul has not truly made the journey to Devachan,
Where the Grail has never been found.
