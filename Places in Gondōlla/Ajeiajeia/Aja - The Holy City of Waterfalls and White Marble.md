*The capital of The River People. It has been developed in the Tales across lifetimes, across Epochs of time. I have maps, placenames, and stories set in this place, of which some keen description can be found in the original Rebirth stories, and also in [[2024-06-08 - Ani born in The City of Waterfalls]]. Given anchor in the Rebirth story on several occasions, including [[Ch 09 . Ajeiajeia]].
