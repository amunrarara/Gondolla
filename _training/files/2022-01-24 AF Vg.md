Idea: Ancient Future beginning in the desert as a young child who is part of a neo-aboriginal tribe, but is essentially kidnapped into semi-slavery when wandering too far into the wastes of an old city, captured by attendees to the empire of Egypt and brought into the city at The Last Cataract to do menial labor with a foster family. Ai's foster parents educate him in the ways of life in Egypt. Ai can test into the Academy, which is his only way to leave the Cataract. Cataract provides a place of exploration into the game mechanics and an opportunity to put computer skills to the test. By exploring this region wholly, the player should be able to leave within 6-10 hours of gameplay, where they are then transferred into the Academy, which is in Lower Egypt, a plainsland beneath the hilly mountains wherein the City of Gold and Water is nested.
