What kinds of new stories can I brainstorm?

Themes:

Death is Discovery
...

Someone is very tied to their ideas, their creation, tries to convince a team that it is great, but the team is moving in a different direction. 

Conscious Desire: have the team create his idea; 

Unconscious Drive: impress his father; 

Achilles Heel: his creations are his success as a man; without being respected in his company, he is less of a man and unworthy of his father's love. 

Moral Imperative: learn to work with a group upon something of far greater value.

Theme: Cooperation leads to something of far greater value

To start, his idea is isolated and unformed; but the team is focused upon projects of a different nature; far more innovative and imaginative. His idea will lead to the _flowering mind systems_ that later give birth to The Echo Project; but first, he must work together with the team.

AIs that mimic the human personality. Overused? Yeah...

Okay okay, let's step back. Into Rebirth. The Chamber of Rebirth that can bring someone back from the dead. If they die while wearing a special medallion, that medallion can be brought to the Chamber of Rebirth, and they can be brought back to life.
