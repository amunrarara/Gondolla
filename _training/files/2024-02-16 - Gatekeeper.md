The role of "Gatekeeper" is of importance in the scribal world, where a person, a document, an LLM, an instructional video, or just the very act of study upon the construct itself, will "pass the knowledge" to the studious programmer. A construct can be a library, program, language, methodology, or quite certainly, *anything*. Imparting strong, working knowledge of the construct is the role and responsibility of the Gatekeeper. 

When a Programmer holds the title of Gatekeeper, for any construct which they are responsible for describing, the intended outcome is for the student to reach a functional state which both Gatekeeper and Student have agreed upon; "the ability to create a Plug in Elixir/Phoenix and successfully merge a PR" is an outstanding goal for Gatekeeper and Student to embark upon.

More often than not, the Gatekeeper in today's programming discipline be a role dictated by the Student, for the Student. The Codex could be a single chapter of documentation, could be a few lines of code tried, deleted, then tried again, could be a tutorial video with several relevant timestamps, a question/response thread between the Student and another Scribe; each, and all, of these form the Codex of the task.

The Codex represents the materials of knowledge which are collected throughout the study of the Construct, which aid in achieving the goal set forth by Student and Gatekeeper.
