# The flow of time is always cruel...

1/16/19
Rust. Changing. Humanity lost and harmony fought against their greed. They birthed a new harmony, which could not live among nature, had to seek its own nature, a place to become itself. High above the clouds. Mankind lost to utter peril, the greed overcame it, its own inner _kami_ corrupted. 

But, hope. That the spirit of humanity could live on in a new nature, a new harmony, that humanity no longer could live among the kami of the earth, and had to rise up, out of it, departing from its mother, protector. Mother Moon...

Living through memories

Memories are shown to us, but nobody remembers where they are from. A world that does not exist, a world of color, not of monochrome. 

Monochrome and Color.

As the journey goes on, RAMA contacts ancient memories. 

Children play, frolic, in fields of green grass, a device rests on their foreheads, the tech around them is beautiful. Flash back. Return. Stuck again in this body of steel. 

Link... the link between childhood and adulthood...

RAMA, the only one who can see the memories stored within the record... Trying to free these memories... 

"Even if we can see them again, even when the memories are freed, what good will they do us?"

Stuck in their loop, never ending cycles of responsibilities without purpose. Maintaining harmony? It is disharmony they maintain, again. But how can harmony return?

Deep within the core of their floating I-land, the last humans waited, sought a cure to the earth's troubles. There they lived, interacting with the world outside through their avatars of steel and cyber, builders of their own prison. Their avatars harvested what was needed. There, they propagated. To their children they gave Avatars. 

A memory; the child's first avatar. 

How many generations have passed since we sought our mother?

Mother is the comfort of home, harmony, hearth. Love. 

Exploitation. Greed. Thieves. 

No longer is the I-Land in the sky; it is upon a space station in orbit round the planet. 

Exiled. Expelled. Cast off into Yomi, the Void. Underpinning despair. Subtext sorrow. Adventure reclaiming what was lost. 

Periodic alarms, madness, because they are not meant to be in their avatars for so long. The sorrow spreads. Sicknesses of the soul that the avatars do not know they even have. Alarms, alerts. Doctors can heal some. Greed sets in. 

There can be no healing, if there is no understanding. 

Below, in the station, the humans have great large windows, the glass is mirrored, nobody can see within, the sunlight cannot penetrate. 

The Ark. Carrier of the seeds of the future. 

The humans have forgotten who they are. Soon, they will die. 

But where is joy? Where is the feeling of happiness? To what are they returning to? 

Joy is only found in their memories. In their longing for home. And perhaps, in their future, when harmony can be remade. 

These happy memories are holograms. The children wear hologram machines on their heads. They run about a simulated Earth. In truth, the Earth is unlivable, but the process of returning is well underway. 

The whole station is a simulation presented to the children to remind them of what they are returning back to. The adults go about their days, in places outside the border fences, where the children "cannot go". Sometimes entering in to give the children their love and affection. The adults wear their Avatars and do the great work for humanity's future.

The childhood world is a simulation designed to remind children of the world that was left behind. 

They can experience gravity, and sometimes deep fantasy. But then there comes a slow change upon the simulation, when they must be made ready for their work. 

When the Data Crash sets in, the adults are stuck in their robot world and forget all else. The children are left within the simulation and cannot escape. There is no harmony. For decades, the children live there, never learning how to leave. RAMA is an adolescent who is born in the simulation, enters into their Avatar, then almost forgets about the real world when the Data Crash occurs. 

The same controllers that the children use to see the simulated world are those that the adults use, just on a lower power setting. At full setting, the simulation completely overtakes the person's body, removing motor functions from the physical body and placing them into the Avatar. RAMA is being transitioned into this role as the Data Crash occurs, losing many memories but still retaining an essence of humanity. RAMA must reclaim these memories throughout the game and save the rest from endlessly repeating their mistakes. 

"A thing that does not change with time is a memory of younger days." -Sheik

Relationship between two worlds: One that stays forever, and one where "when" exists

"We have always been and will always be. Can you not see it? We do not age, we do not grow, we do not change. There is nothing about us that resembles these memories of a far-gone time. If the humans have created us, then they have left us, too, as we are eternal, and they just a memory."

Story opens with childhood memories, long experiences. Shook from this memory and thrust into the monochromatic world. These memories are half of the experience. Deeper memories, as well, of Earth, simulations, experiences. The children were given many lessons about the world, history. These memories are locked within each person of the Data Crash, but they remember nothing after entering adulthood. Why? 

Because all memories relating to Avatar life were torn away from a certain point, but not childhood. When the full intensity of the simulation took hold, they lost themselves. 

A blending scene, when the childhood simulation is played to RAMA in his Avatar form. He navigates a world, running into things, in his simulation. He is considered mad, crazy, by the others, being a dreamer seeing color in a monochromatic world. Others have this experience, and they are deactivated. 

This story, necessarily, needs to be bound to fantasy, or else falling prey to the difficulty of scientific believability. 

Symbols of loss: tree stump

**Children who never grow up. Adults who lose their way, lost in their construct. The bridge between the two, the reason for both to exist, the harmony, the link, was also lost.** 

**RAMA must serve now as that link.** 

**He must lead the adults out of their entrapment so they can rescue their children from an unrealistic prison.** 

**The adults must leave their simulation, their Avatars, their world where they are lost, and return to their true selves, their neglected and forgotten Human forms, then gracefully lead the children out from their entrapment in an unrealistic paradise, into their true responsibility: restoring harmony in a world that was destroyed by greed. They all must sacrifice their ties to unhealthy ideals to restore balance to nature and humanity.**

Both the adults and the children are estranged from each other. When RAMA reveals to them the true nature they have forgotten, they each must resist the temptation to _sit beneath the tree forever,_ to never let go of childhood/adulthood, and instead restore the bridge between the two.
