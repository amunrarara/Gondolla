We have learned from the temple builders of old that those who come after will always sought after the treasures kept within, the earthly, the secular, the spiritual, the treasures many. But we know that our heavenly mantle depends on the treasures within in order to secure for us the greatest possible afterlife. We cannot allow the gree and curiousity of our descendants to disrupt our heavenly mantle, therefore we must make to all ends an impossible crypt that cannot be emptied, which will preserve us forevermore, sealed even from the builders and their descendents. Perhaps the incense may be burnt in the antechamber, but not further. My treasures will remain my own even beyond my departure from this world, aand I will not be robbed in my afterlife, so help me protectors of the soul and spirit that this may be true. 

The great scribes, the mighty architects, the builders, the painters, the programmers, all of us must unite to create the most incredible tombs of our age, to secure ourselves in the afterlife.
