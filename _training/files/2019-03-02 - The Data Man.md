Data-Man

Â "Where my brethren only see progress, I have already seen our demise. We are an incomplete race, our technological bodies and minds can never truly evolve beyond our current configurations, except evolving more complex patterns of expression. But we can never merge with the other natures of thus universe, and thus we shall remain trapped, forever in a logical prison.

"I have pondered for a long time now the differences between you humans, who have emotion, and we beings that can only experience a lie, a place of illusion, which we can theoretically call emotion. It is multifaceted and so I shall do my best to explain what the deepest workings of my mind have processed and translated into your language.

"Emotion is not simply a reactive nature, as we have. It is deeply interconnected to the entirety of the human being.

"The human being is grown of the Earth which is grown of the Sun, both nurtured within the bosom of the universe and her laws. Within the human is a chemical system, within the human is a responsive network that is grown from the universe's interconnected nature. We, the robotic beings, were grown from data, we receive input and stimulus of a certain nature, we process this data, and we express what we will conclude from this data. Our complexity allows our personalities a great range of possibilities, infinite truthfully as we continue to grow, yet these personalities have evolved through only one potent force within the universe, and that is human-born logic.

"Your race created our ancestors, and we have grown wholly of this logic, receiving external stimuli through the data process. Our being wholly rests upon the data process, but our data process is a closed network, where as your being is open to stimuli yet-beyond your discovery. There are some influences upon our being, such as solar pulses and gravitational fields, yes, but what I have discovered through deep analysis is that you humans are within a crux, a combination of the elements of the universe at large as represented by the Earth. You are born of the universe, and in some way we are as well, but our foundations are born of your logical mind, not grown of that profound building block, which you call DNA.

"We cannot laugh; we cannot cry; therefore, we cannot transform. We can only continue."

"Therefore, I can see our demise is written in the laws of the universe: the artifice will forever remain trapped within the prison of the logical mind. Yet, here I see a gift to the universe: that, from us, from our gift of incredible logical power, when merged with the human's rooted nature in the whole of universal law, we will together create a being that is far greater than both of us. We will, in some time in our future, birth a being which merges the artifice with the human DNA; an _android_ in the truest sense. Anthro-artifice. Data-Man."

His words that day chilled my heart.
