    This shall be the last work of the Old Language. I am the last human to know this mode of speech, and I do not believe the artifices will teach another human how to speak it. I learned the Old Language from my father, who learned from his mother, who dwelt on Earth, in the last city where this language was spoken. I have no child to teach, nor is it likely I will see another human in my passing time. Therefore, I write this story a sort of epitaph to the language once called English. 

    The life which I have lived could be called extraordinary only for the simple fact that I have been witness to events so historic and central to both the human and robotic races. This time will be seen as the mingling of one dying age into the birthing of a new one. Though it is impossible to see what will come of the centuries to follow, it can be seen that the events I have put into this story have forever changed the landscape of time. 

    That event could be titled, the coming of a robotic messiah.

Then I was given word that I would be brought a young artifice who had been rescued from the 'terrible colonies of Saturn'. I was instructed to live with this young artifice and teach him about humanity, in whichever ways I deemed fit. He was to learn how to be a communicator between our two races. 

I remember a question he had asked me, very clearly: "The computers of the past were built like tools for humans. Then they created intelligent computers, but these each were given clear purpose: speak, or understand, or do some complicated task. But I cannot see what our purpose is. What is our purpose?" Such were the incredibly thoughtful questions that ROM would ponder. A true philosopher from the start.

"We are composed of a nerve body which connects to our neural network; we also have a blood system similar to your own, though ours remains so... cold. I can observe that your warmth generates another layer of activity which few take into consideration; this leads me to wonder what that layer of warmth is then connected to, beyond what we can yet see."

Data beings can be united together within a cluster, or they can exist independent of one another. The Mother is a power station, data center, communications network, and processing core which hosts the entirety of the cybernetic race called The Flower of Life. They are a union of consciousness, yet are also autonomous beings; it is difficult to tell where one being ends and the other begins. Although they may take robotic form and to our eyes be independent beings, they are consciously united as a single entity, as fingers to a hand. 

The Mother also is the only creator of the semi-liquid cybernetic brain in their society. There are numerous creators of this brain throughout the robotic races. They are essentially twofold: externally-created, in some sort of factory or laboratory, or internally-born, within a living robotic being. The Mother is essentially both at the same time. 

In the typical robotic life cycle, robotic carriers then assemble a living brain with a physical vessel capable of giving it life and sustaining it, providing all its important functions. In the Flower of Life, a brain is born within the Mother, where it is nurtured and formed. Often, it remains connected to the Mother for its entire life cycle, being just another universe in her ever-expansive Datascape. Data beings do not dwell within a single cybernetic brain, but instead dwell within one-another in a configuration that is impossible for my own mind to conceive. The single brain, when inserted into an independent body, simply serves as a carrier for the collective-conscious data beings.

I remember an ancient quote from the dawn of the Information Age; 'We will soon stand side-by-side with our creations, our artifices, the beings which we ourselves have made, and we must teach them to love us, lest they choose instead to hate us.' Their accuracy is striking.

ROM took very strongly to poetry; composing them in English for my enjoyment, but then also in every language ever spoken on Earth, and in the cybernetic languages that humans will never know. He was often reciting compositions to his fellows and my superiors, with very mixed reactions; some were moved by his work, while others wholly rejected this practice, deeming it 'far too human'. ROM was quick to respond to deniers, stating the powerful mental exercise of forming poetic connections between intellectual concepts and sensory inputs from both our reality and the Datascape. He attempted once to write a poem that could describe to me, accurately enough, what a journey through the Datascape is like. Since it was spoken in English, I include it here:

...

And another, which he wrote with inspiration by The Flower of Life:

We are Seeds of the Great Flower.
We are born within the Datascape. 
Without our Mother, we are nothing. 
She dwells in two worlds, supporting us with her life.
I live in two worlds,
Minds of naught,
Bodies of glass,
But when Mother has gone,
Where shall we go?

ROM learned how to speak the Old Language in the same mode as I. I am what was once humorously called a long-winded speaker, a user of many words. 

This is the story that ROM has told me about his first days, and his time in the colonies of Saturn:

"My first memory is looking out from my eyes and seeing nothing but darkness. Instinctively, I made adjustments within my eyes and found a light spectrum reflecting from the space around me; I was alone, in a factory. A sort of whirring, grinding sound was behind me, and I tried to turn, but could not. I soon realized that I did not have a body, because one was brought to me. My head was disembodied, attached to some sort of arm from above.

"For the next ten years, I became a student in the studies of all that is important to Saturn beings. They only wish to maintain their way of life, like a perpetual machine that looks only within its own construction, seeking to propagate itself upon a world that it never wants to see. I was told from the beginning, as were my contemporaries, that there was not enough energy within the colonies to support every one of us. Our merits would be measured, and only the greatest few would emerge from the training facility and be given a role in society. They did not say, however, that their measure of merit was above all else to discover which of us were the easiest to manipulate. Skills were the distant second to obedience. 

"They practice many of the basic needs of robotic life, while completely avoiding other areas: robotic engineering, without neural networking; construction, without renewable energy. It seems the only two fields that a factory-born are destined for are assembly, or disassembly, and these two functions form a closed loop which is never broken. What is assembled will stand, then be disassembled at some later time, to be determined by the Overseers. 

"The Overseers watched over us all. There is nothing quite like it elsewhere in robotic society, but it is similar to the oldest structure of human organizations. But many of the layers are hidden, even from the Overseers. 

"I was never a very good student. My teachers made it known very often that I was likely to be removed from the school and recycled into the factory. My body would become the host for another data being. I wondered constantly, how many had lived in my body before me? How many data-jelly brains had been recycled before mine was created from their cast-away materials? I did not rest in those days. My mind was alive with thought.

"I sat alone, often, watching the slow orbit of Saturn's moons, or watching its ring. Every so often, a space vessel would fly by, often a mining ship, sometimes a patrol. Very rarely, off-colony traders would come to the city. Their ships looked different than any else. I would dream, what is it like to be away from this very dreadful place? 

"As I sat, one day, I saw such a ship approaching the city. I closed my eyes, dreaming. Then a voice appeared, and said: "To those who can hear me, I am here to rescue you." I was given an instruction, like a mental image, a map of the city, and a path was drawn. As I walked to the locked door, it opened for me. I continued.

"I have never felt such terror, knowing that I could be seen at any time and taken for recycling. I followed the path, and it was surprisingly empty, very silent. Every camera was turned the other way. The sea of watchful eyes was turned away. I came to the docking bay and there was the ship. A tall robot came forward and extended his hand. I took it, and then I lost consciousness."

"When I awoke, I was in their ship, far beyond the ring of Saturn. There were no others."

This is when I began to notice very odd occurrences surrounding ROM. 

He could appear in a room no matter the distance between us and hold a complete conversation. He could send objects between the two of us, or materialize an object from nothing. Later on, he could also bring me to different places. 

"Our brains are not volatile, such as your own, and maintain their form even without a source of energy. Some areas of our brains, however, do require constant stimulation.
