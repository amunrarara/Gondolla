# Neuratic Signature
We share a code that is felt, and never seen. With our Mind’s Gaze we move our attention to points in our physical brains that are felt and seen by both our inner eye, and the machine’s eye. We control the movement of this gaze inside, and the machine knows where we are gazing. With this, we draw a pattern, and this pattern is our Signature. We learn many signatures and use them throughout our dealing with gold machines.

Gold Machines / Hieratic Gold

There is a special alloy that is devised by the Hieratic and used only to encase high technology. This way it is easily identifiable as a Hieratic Machine. The data leaves within the machine also glimmer with that unmistakable golden hue, and will perform only instructions written in the Hieratic Script.

Encased in Holy Metal,
Hieratic Gold.
