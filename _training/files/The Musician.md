Just as Ani was about to step away, the musician recognized the emblem stitched upon the scribe’s collar, and then noticed the device hanging from a strap at his hip.

The musicians completed their song, and the tent was alive with chatter, activity, smoking, dancing, singing, and clapping. The young scribe began a conversation with one of the flagrantly-dressed musicians, who was holding a drum, and sang in exuberant tones between pauses in the laborious conversation.

“Ah, wait just a moment; we have a resurrectionist in our midst.”

Ani felt his cheeks growing warm. The musician clapped a hand on the shoulder of his fellow, and beckoned Ani the Scribe toward a circle of pillows. “Come, come, let us talk about life.”

Ani chose a stiff, upright cushion, making himself as comfortable as he was capable.

”I was once one of you, you know,” the musician exhaled, as he rolled casually onto a spread of cushions, made of red woven wool. “Obsessed with the past, buried in the future, thinking always of the craft. I would dream for no end about those damn machines.” He reached into his pocket and withdrew a long hollow stick. From a bowl beside him, he took a pinch of shredded leaves and pressed them into one end of the stick, which he put above a candle, and withdrew slow wisps of smoke.

”I’d once thought I’d waste my whole life away, resurrecting forgotten things from those dusty old machines, and building up an old world again. I’d ******wanted****** it to be my life. I was quite good at it, too, for a time.”

Ani didn’t know whether he was meant to feel curious of the musician, or insulted by insinuations he’d thought he heard in his anecdote. “What made you stop and join the circus, then?”

“Oho, the boy can play!” retorted the musician, and he perked up from his pillowy-perch. “Scribes can be snappy, so they say, and here’s the living proof of it.”

”Well, go on then,” said Ani, “tell me where your craft had led you. Do you still write code?”

The musician let out a sort of huff-and-grunt all at once. “I have not touched a machine for well over ten years now. And I am a better man for it!”

“It is not the machine that makes nor breaks the man, we say.”

“And that is exactly what I’d expect to hear from a scribe.” He took a long puff of smoke, and let it blow out from his nostrils. Ani thought he looked very much like a big, puffy dragon.

“I defended the craft too, when I was a younger, simple-minded man. I listened keenly to that dogma from the Academy; I loved it, in fact. I wanted to immerse myself fully into it. And so, I did.” He took another pinch of leaves from the bowl, speaking lowly as he did so.

”I wanted so deeply for others to understand it all, too; my family, my loved ones, my village folk. What I would have given for them all to just ****understand**** me, and care about that message like I did. I was so _passionate_ about the Academy in those days. To understand how _********wonderful********_ it all was, that world inside the machine, and the wonders it could reveal to us. Most of all, I wanted to find the _answers_ to it all.” He took yet another puff of smoke into his mouth, and blew it out from his nostrils.

”But, I came to understand, there _**are**_ no answers, not truly. None that would satisfy _me_, anyway.”

A beautiful woman swept slowly out from the crowd, and came to kneel, sensuously, at the musician’s side. She wore a lustrous emerald-green cloth that covered her head and shoulders, with very little else to cover her tan and shapely body. “Mafu, oh Mafu, my sweet rose, come and have a drink with me.” She wrapped her arms around his neck and swung into his lap in one graceful, dancing motion. They began to laugh together.

“Yes, my morning dove, I will be yours again very shortly. I am espousing the gospel of wine and music to this young scribe at the moment. Go and be merry, and I will find you once he has apostatized.”

She turned her head slowly, slyly, and cast Ani a stare that sent shivers through his entire body; so beautiful her eyes, so powerful her gaze. Back to the musician she turned those eyes, “If that is what you wish, my love. But do not keep me waiting long, I desire your company far more than I desire to remain decent among tonight’s guests.”

Rising in a single breath, she dissolved back into the crowd, swinging her hips with every exaggerated step. Mafu, the musician, stared at her until she disappeared from sight. He sighed, his eyes resting lazily on the spot where last she stood. “Ah, my young friend. It is love that led me away from the Academy.”

He turned to face Ani again, his cheeks more colorful than before, a bead of perspiration forming on his upper lip. “It is the warmth of blood that brought me back to life. The passion! A _real_ life, a life _worth_ living. The present, the real; a world I can touch, of joys, and pleasures, and my _**own**_ memories to unfold.”

He waved his hand dismissively and looked off toward the crowd again. “Your profession is far too cold for someone like me. I cannot be troubled to carry out the dreams of lesser men who forgot how to live in their own skin.”

Ani was feeling his blood get hotter, now. “So you’ve found a den of familiars that can satisfy your lusts and cravings; I am happy for you. I have no interest in what’s to offer here, unfortunately; your music was well-performed, I’ll give you that, and your woman is very beautiful to behold; but I could not imagine spending more than a summer’s breath in a coven of woeful, purposeless debaucheries such as this.”

Mafu’s chest rose a little higher, and he spoke more forcefully. “This place very much has its purpose, my young friend, though you clearly do not see it. It is a purpose offered unto itself; to _enjoy_ your life, and live every breath its fullest; to experience many pleasures, and revel in the splendor of the life worth living.”

”And yet,” responded Ani, “that is not what I find here, at all. At least, not for me.”

“Then do tell me, young friend; what it is that brings you Inspiration from your craft.” Mafu sat back upon his pillow.

Ani held his words for a moment, then released his thoughts. "It is through my mind that I find my heart. And by my hope to resurrect the world that once brought so many together in communion, to share their knowledge, communicate freely and openly, and to keep eternal records of their mighty deeds.”

Ani raised the glass-and-metal object that hung from his shoulder in both hands. “By my tablet, I remember what none alive could _keep_ alive by spoken word alone, and by _this_ memory I see clearly the way I will walk unto the present and the future.”

Ani pointed sharply toward the city gates. “I have learned things about our world within the halls of that Academy that none outside its walls could ever _dream_ to know without the aid of machines and long memories now buried in the sands of time. The power this ability bestows upon me… it is immeasurable.”

Ani leaned forward, and looked Mafu squarely in the eyes. “So, although I do not muddle my thoughts with the pleasures of the vine and the company it begets, I would say that the pleasure I gain is _quite_ in line with my desires, and _that_ carries me upon wings of greatness and glory, among my own company… as does your music for you, and might I add, your very rich personality as well.”

Mafu stared at Ani for a moment. After several breaths had passed, a thin smile appeared across the musician’s glassy face. Rising from his reclined position across the spread of pillows, he sat keenly on crossed legs.

“Now you’re gaining my interest, scribe! A little desire will go a long way, you know. Oh how you remind me of how much I had longed to learn what goes on beyond those walls, in that tower of stones and mystery, when I was a child… And you, you have lived that great mystery!” Mafu shouted many fast words to a man near the bar, who quickly brought over two tall beverages, rich with the smell of mint and honey. Mafu took both glasses, and offered one to Ani, who hesitated a moment, but took it. Mafu raised his glass, and gave Ani a very warm smile, before taking a large sip.

“Tell me about your time in that palace of mysteries, my friend, and do warm your words with that passion-fire that revealed itself in your last bout of clever words.”

… ******************later in the night****************** …

“So you had once a tablet of your own, then?” sincerely questioned Ani.

“Oh, yes,” Mafu replied beneath a mournful sigh. “Long hours I would spend, in my childhood years, indoors through the beautiful days of spring, drawing my fingers across that shining piece of rock. It belonged to my grandfather, who had entered the Academy in its very early years. Such a sorry state that tablet was in by the time I’d gotten it; agëd, dusty, and cracked; but so rich was the adventure contained within it, that I’d scarcely cared that the vessel which carried me there had lost its better days. I think what really drew me, thinking back now, was the aether, that crisp brightness, like holding the full moon in your very hands. It was…” He looked off, into the crowd. “…intoxicating.”
