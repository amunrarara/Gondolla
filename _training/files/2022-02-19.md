Rebirth came through a few days ago, again, last I wrote. It plays on the edge of my mind, dances with the life of my thoughts, gives me hope to know that my creativity can thrive, still. All of these narratives that come through me, they're really just a vreative sort of way for me to get to know my own thinking universe. Rebirth has to do with the evolution of reincarnation beliefs, and the possibility of refined astral travel. Data Crash is my thoughts about how the world may be affected by an overnight removal of the internet, essentially, and the loss of most of the world's data, a sort of Great Reset. Echo is a tale that connects to Data Crash, and to Rebirth actually, where in a robotic species was sent into the farthest reaches of space, out from the Earth, to populate, research, collect information, and develop themselves into a refined entity free of the enshacklement of their forebearers, the humans. There, they live ompletely robotic lives, which bear analogou expression to humanity's own trappings and behaviors, and I wove humanity in there in all sorts of ways.
