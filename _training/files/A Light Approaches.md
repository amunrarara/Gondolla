An owl calls across the cold twilight. The stars shimmer, clear and luminous across an endless sky. 

Two old men sit alone, beside each other, on a log at the edge of a stream, surrounded by boughs of old trees, in the hills of their ancestors.

One says to the other, "Look up," and he points to the sky, where a light was shimmering brighter than it had the night before.

The other looks up. The two do not speak, but they know what the other is thinking. 

They had spoken about that light every night for seven nights.

"There's three colors. Fire, water, tree."

"And snow. Sometimes."

They sat, again, looking up into the sky, saying nothing else until the sun sent the stars away. 

It was another three nights before the star split into three.

Each star shimmered, growing brighter every night. 

Others came to join the men; they watched the sky, quietly, as night became day. Each night, the stars grew brighter, again.

Some who came held polished glass to help their eyes see clearer. 

Some made marks on fallen leaves, told others what they saw. Messages were sent across the river, up and down.

Some spoke prayers, some prayed in silence.

Others came alone, or together in groups, to look a moment, then leave. Those who spoke loudly were asked to be quiet.

On the thirteenth night, the stars fell from the sky.

The sky was cut by fire, three times, and filled with smoke of many colors.

Those gathered saw each other, just for a moment, when the sky was bright as daylight. 

Then, just as quick as it came, the darkness returned. 

The stars fell north, beyond the Holy Mountain. 

For those who watched by the river, a new age had now begun.

It was a moonless night.
