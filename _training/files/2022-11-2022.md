(Written on the ferry from Igoumenitsa to Kerkyra, western Greece)

"How daft, our forebears, so confident in their powers of mind, devoid of the true devotion to Life Herself, focused ever in the making of greater control machines, masters of flesh and chemical, forgetting purpose, foregoing reason in pursuit of ever-purer logic, which was turned against us, their children of time. We hide from the sun in the catacombs of Mother's Womb, drinking droplets which the Air graces us with, in its dances with the Stones. We eat only what you, Fathers, Mothers, thought fit to leave for us as you left this world, and left us to its sorrows. For guardians, you have us murderous metal cratures which we cannot kill, only prevent from entering our final sanctuaries, how horrible your selfish deeds, to leave us beehind in this world. We pick at the scraps, while above you look down upon us from the starry mount..."

"Thouse these words echo in the storyteller's halls now loudly, do not lose hope. Open the eye which can see the spirits tht walk now among us, us who are last to complete the final journey to the Real we have prepared for years out of measure. Our purpose is not yet fulfilled, for flesh we have taken as our mantle, and spirits we yet do not see as we should. Be instead to your thinking stools, atop scorching mountains, perilous caverns, and stay quiet as to ward away the Watchers, and the Hunters they serve."
