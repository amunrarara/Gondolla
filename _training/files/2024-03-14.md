"We of the Walking Way respect all Beings of this Universe. When looking toward Davinda in Ilyana, we see our spiritual homeland, and The Doors of Day which lead to them. We know the Beings of this Universe are plentiful and many-numbered, and for many, we know the names which the various Adánic peoples of the many worlds have given to them. 

"Naming is a beautiful act, but matching names to the same concrete phenomenas is another matter entirely, for, with Vandra, Anavandra, and the lesser *evándi*, we notice they form themselves and press upon the mind of Adáni in manifold ways, representing swaths of forces, and sometimes transforming depending on the relationship between Adani and the various potencies they come into contat with. 

"As the elements make up our own bodies, so too do the Adani make up the anchor points for the Vandra to swell upon a world; listless in the cosmos, they become, when no Adani worships them any longer.

"So to the question of 'the many-numbered Vandra, Anavandra, and evandra, and who is the ultimate chief among them', we Wayfarers believe in each potent importance as part of the tapestry of the whole, for this best serves our mission of travel between the many regions of Gondōlla; We do not profess one as the Divine Personality of Godhead, for we practice a lesser way, and our religion is imperfect; this is known to us, but it is our way.

"To master this Universe and finally transcend it, we go to the place where the material burden of this galaxy is least, Davinda at the heart of Gondolla, and there we focus cleary upon the true Figurehead of all potencies, all Beings, all forms and forces of the many universes. And to this Being, we do not give a name, for if we are reminded of it, we may not remainin in Gondolla very long, so instead we speak of Their Eminent Abode, Ëia, and for us, that is enough to keep us wandering ever-closer to the heart of Gondōlla."
