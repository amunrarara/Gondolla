Ai exits from a door that has not opened for a century. There is a group of children passing through these tunnels below the catacombs, who have passed by this door one thousand times and never seen it. Ai steps into the tunnel, and they are amazed. "Wow! How cool! This robot looks so ancient! Check out its legs! He's made of such a strong alloy! He's incredible!" They lead Ai back to Baba Banya, who quickly 'takes him under his wing'. Ai can run with the children through the biodomes collecting trinkets to sell, or explore the now-revealed Catacombs region and bring back any treasures he finds, for Baba's favor, and money. 

This constitutes a major portion of Ai's first chapter in the tale, exploring the hills and crags of the Cataract region, with its many failed biodomes. I'm interested in making the Cataract area into its own biodome, as well.
