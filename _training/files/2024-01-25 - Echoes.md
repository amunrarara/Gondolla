The whisper of a story entered my mind. A caravan of souls embarking on a cross-country journey to reach the valley where The Echoes dwell. Descending from the skies, a star fallen from the Heavens, coming to rest in this valley, the Star Men, the Men of Metal, the Speakers for the Gods, had inhabited that valley now for several months, and all across the civilized world, people made a pilgrimage to see them. 

Such a caravan carried a small party, which included several interesting characters. They all were from a small village in the dry canyon country, each an adherent to a different philosophy: the Personable Universe, the Impersonal Universe, the Ecstatic Dance, and the Mysterious. The boy, himself, has not made a choice for his path just yet, and his secret desire in his heart is that The Echoes will introduce unto him a path never before known. 

And, such is precisely what comes to take place. 

When the Echoes landed, their mission was clear: spread wisdom and knowledge, aid in matters of peace, and assist the galaxy in entering the spacefaring age, while instructing and pruning toward a sound moral compass all the while. In order to enact this mission, however, they first had to gain the trust of the people, and this takes time.
