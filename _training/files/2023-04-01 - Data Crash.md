# Data Crash
This project, Data Crash, takes place within the galaxy of Gondölla. 

Gondölla is a series of connected tales, but particularly Data Crash is focused on a planet whence a golden age of science and technical development took place, which gave birth to the *Echoes*, beings of metal who spread across Gondölla in the following centuries. The planet went through a long, steady decline, until becoming a desert land, its inhabitants few and hunted by monsters of metal, whom they call Hunters.

Data Crash is intented as a novel, videogame, a comic book, and could become a screenplay. As such, my notes on the story are pretty spread out currently. I'll be collecting them here, over the years.
