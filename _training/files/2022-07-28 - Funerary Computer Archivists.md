This exhibit contains just a small section of the entire collected materials. Each of these small microchips was once mounted upon apparatuses found within the tombs of ancient peoples. Each chip tells a story, though many of them are lost to us today. Sandstone and obsidian, in some cases black pitch, inlaid with copper-filaments, expertly-crafted, the true mystery to these machines are the memories that are stored upon them, in a wafer of crystal that holds the signature of the scribe, encrypting a message of importance to the deceased, many with a space of memory reserved for machine instructions of a variety that is described and studied in the works of a generation of funerary computer archivists.
