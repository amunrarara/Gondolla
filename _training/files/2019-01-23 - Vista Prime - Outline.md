Outline and more

There has been a blocking consideration to my story and that is a grasping at realism. I must shift this pursuit of _realism_ into a pursuit of _internal believability_. A consistency to the experience as a whole. I will write this world and create this story and if it is destined to be created as video games, so be it. If it manifests as a comic book, then so be it! But I am a wordsmith, through and through, from the beginning, and that is what I know that I can create with my own two hands, and thus that is what this story shall be: a written work.

A basic outline of the things happening:
    Upon a great **space station**, there live **robotic beings** who have **forgotten their origins** entirely. They measure time beginning at The New Era, a moment in time called the **Data Crash**, when all memory had been lost from all time previous. From then, their society was rebuilt, and a strict **hierarchy** established, placing some individuals very far at the top, metaphorically and literally, and the rest in descending order to the bottom. Like a great pyramid with an **elite** looking over them. 
    The robotic beings live within the bounds of the station, only leaving when their assigned task is to do so. **Energy is scarce**, and those who do not work are not given a very necessary recharge. They will become de-energized and their form be recycled. 
    In this world, four hundred years after the Data Crash, a robotic being is born who will **begin to remember** what happened before the Crash. This being will **unravel the secrets** of their origins, **reveal the corruption** at the heart of their society, and reconnect the robotic beings with their very real counterparts, the actual lives that sustain them: their human bodies. 

Prelude
    Deep within the station live the human counterparts to the robotic avatars who live above. Four hundred years ago, the **Data Crash** had far-reaching disastrous results, one of which being the **entrapment** of the **humans** **in** **cybernetic stasis**. But this stasis was no accident; it was cleverly engineered by some of the scientists among them who desired power, and dominance, and had lost faith in the project they undertook altogether. 
    All who are born on the station are the descendants of Earth's estranged humanity. As the **Earth** plummeted into an **inhospitable** **environment** (for humans), a very large group of world scientists began the **Avatar Program**; from a station orbiting the Earth, these **scientists inhabited** **robotic avatars** that could complete tasks in the inhospitable regions of the Earth, with the hopes of **restoring the balance of life** and **reshaping Earth** again into **humanity's home**. As the Earth plunged into darkness, **all life on its surface was lost**, and those who lived on the station were the last bastion of human life. 
    Generations passed, continuing this work of restoration through the work of the robotic avatars. **Children were raised in a holographic simulation** of Earth's places of paradise, instilling love and faith for the work they would complete throughout their lifetimes. When a child reached a certain age, they could begin **the bridge process**, slowly **releasing them from the simulation** of childhood **into the reality** of their situation. The child would be trained in the use of an avatar, then would enter their **life's work**, forsaking the childhood simulation, until the time when they might have children and again return to that magical place. 
    Among the inhabitants of the station grew a discontentment when the scientists discovered the **true futility** of their situation; if Earth would be inhabitable again, it would not be for **hundreds of generations**. The **rocket technology to travel** to the distant planet **Mars** may be possible, but it would require a complete shift of their work, and they would **forsake the Earth entirely**, traveling instead to the planet Mars to begin a new colony. There were some who wanted to begin that project, and the rest wanted to complete their work on the Earth, no matter how long it would take. This **rift** had very deep consequences. 
    To begin the Martian expedition, a great store of resources had to be collected from Earth; this required a literal **split** in the operation. This caused fighting. This fighting led to violence. The violence caused bitter conflict among the inhabitants of the station. **One faction sabotaged the other**, then this led to an even greater sabotage. 
    **In secret**, one scientist was developing **a plan**, beginning with a computer program that would change the lives of the inhabitants forever. The program would do a series of things: when a human entered their avatar, it would **entrap** them within it by disguising and **encrypting** the **life return protocol**; it would disguise and encrypt their own **memory files**; then, when every human was sealed within their robotic prison, all memory from the days before would be encrypted, and **unavailable** for access to any **who** **did** **not possess the key**. 
    With all memory lost, and their forms kept within the neural construct of their robotic avatars, all the humans upon the station were imprisoned within the reality of robotic existence, **unable to return** to their bodies, utterly **forgetting** **life beyond** the surface of the station. Confusion was beset by panic, which then was **used by the key master to unite them** into an organized society, **his vision** of **a paradise of metal and bone**.  
    **The key master** kept his secrets all the way to his death. His **cyber** **specter** remains alive within the station's **datascape;** the holder of the key, the illusion of his life. That specter continues on as **the** **leader** of the robotic society. 

    The Story World

A small group of robotic beings (**Life Keepers**) are brought to take care of the human children. They assist the bridging process. They also take care of the humans that are in stasis, assuring their life continues, and when it ends, that they are properly disposed of. 

Notes and Additions
You cannot go back and change what has been lost in time. But you can visit those times and recover what may have been forgotten, or unable to have been understood.

So in a story like this, if it were created as a video game, I would like to travel back in time through memory but have no effect on the future. A **Memory Engine** that allows for deep possibilities to be explored.

Essentially, the Key Master created his vision of a united colony: humanity would continue, while the Earth would slowly restore balance, someday enabling life to return to the surface. He foresaw that the process would take hundreds of generations, and decided this would be the best way to sustain human life. Whether he was justified or moral in his actions, is up to the reader. 

Blade Runner: "**Gift them with a past...**" means to provide a character an emotional context. Supporting theme: **control of memories gives control of identity**

Narrative

CORE: \\ MEMORYBANK \\ LOADALL TO \\NEUNET
ERROR >> ALL DATA SOURCES IN MEMORYBANK CORRUPTED... CANNOT COMPLETE DATA TRANSFER

Within every file created before The New Era, this message is displayed. The files are corrupted. **There is no recovering what was lost**.

What has been lost? The memory of what once was. The origins. The story before the story. There is nobody who knows what the world was like before, and even if they did remember, **what would it matter to their world today**? **Great progress** is the call sign of The New Era, uniting all that lives and processes; they all have come so far.
