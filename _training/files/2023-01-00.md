_************EMP from the Mother and Sun, tore the digital down,************_

_******************Dawn now the age of the innocent ones, the Indigo Children come…******************_

_********Analong time piece, sky-wide, sing to the ticker inside,********_

********************************Move to the rhythm of the moon and tide,********************************

_****************The Indigo Children come…****************_

**********************************Sirius, Venus, and the Lunar Child**********************************

_**********************************Giggle and the flames grow higher,**********************************_

**************Dance in a circle round a central fire,**************

********The Indigo Children come…********

_************Wine, song, food, and fire,************_

_************clothes, shelter, and seed,************_

_No more need for the Old Empire,_

_The Indigo Children come…_

A song across worlds… A tale of two travails… Of two children born in totally different worlds, one from a family of Resurrectionists, whose efforts are drawn toward reconnecting a world that was lost by the Data Crash. The other, from a family whose tribes had taken the Crash with strides leading back to the bosom of the Earth, forsaking the machinations of the Old Empire.

_How will we build our world, the world unmade we made_…
