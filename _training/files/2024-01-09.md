"As Lords of the Earth, how dare we even think ourselves worthy of the honor to order the world about us, what does it take for a man to determine himself worthy of deciding which will live and which will die? To what gender do we assign the dooms of leadership?"

"It is a grave supposition to believe us Lords of the Earth, friend, and the very thought of it belies your belonging to that race of invaders who have besieged the lands which are touched by the waters of our Holy Mountain. It is grave, the doom of leadership, yes, but such a post is destitute of honor when seized so mercilessly. I do not consider any to be Lords of the Earth, except for Earth Herself."
