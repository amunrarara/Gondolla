    In this story, there's a boy, a young man really, who lives in a world that is reserved only for children, typically. He has the option to upgrade out of this old simulation, but he chooses not to. Why is that? The new simulation that is offered to him is bland, tasteless, unimaginative, strange, and there, he has only a little control. At least with the simulation for children, he has some creative ability. 
Though it isn't common for adults to carry this program, he clings onto it, loving it for its colors, its ability to change his reality into anything he truly wishes.
    But that's all just imaginative stuff, right? There's nothing there but smoke and mirrors; a mirage that may look pretty, but doesn't bring any value to society.
    He's expected to start working soon, now that he's out of the school system. He will use his simulation for another purpose; counting numbers, writing reports, that sort of adult stuff. He's not only dreading the thought of it, I think he'd really explode and take a part of the company out with him. He's a little explosive, that one. He's known to fly the coop if enraged past his limits.
    There's this girl; a wild child, she goes by the name of Darcy; she's never actually plugged in to the simulation before; she's somehow against it, and her family is a bunch of artists; freaks, really. They don't live in the simulated way. Somehow they've figured out a way to grow their own food and live without the system. Darcy comes into the city only once in a while to see bands performing downtown. She's a music freak. 
    So this story is partly about him _not_ blowing his lid and tearing the corporate world a new asshole, and partly about him learning how to love Darcy. 

    In the end, there's a moral to it. 

"We let go of the imagination of being a child to become the imagination of being an adult. And what a boring idea of adulthood we've constructed this time around. We think that it makes some sort of a difference to the universe to be a paper-pusher up in a high-rise prison of exploitation. Either way, it's all just make-believe; at least the child gets dragons instead of drag-me-downs."
