I've been exploring the new story of the Wandering Tribe, I think I will call the tale Ways Between Worlds, at least as a working title. Maybe it will be The Walk Between Worlds, though that doesn't quite grab in the same way now, does it? But I think it will be colloquially referred to as "Tales from Gond√∂lla" or something like that. I am sure the Echoes will find mention in this tale, though I am unsure whether we will necessarily meet them. Still, I think this could be a truly wondrous videogame. Well, writing a novel is quite a lot of work in its own right
