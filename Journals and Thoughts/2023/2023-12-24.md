We are Beings, within Beings, within Beings, with Beings within us. We are part of the great tapestry of life, that is spinning round in the Many-Spiral Dance. In our veins, a great spiral, in our atoms, many spirals, and in our skies, around our Suns, around the heart of our galaxy, another spiral. We are the Dancers, and the Dance. We are the Dreamers, and the Dream.
