"The Divinity which I serve has been Lord of the Skies since the birth of this mighty galaxy. It is by their power that this dance with darkness began. For it is known, among the wise, that the Light was born in contention of the Darkness, that the Day finds its home and whole purpose in its conflict with the Night, that were it not for the powers of Night, life itself would find no form, only the formless, and bear no Will of its own. It is Shaddah which has cooled the forces of Light and made us into who we are. There is no denying this. The greatest of Wayfarers know this to be true. Except, I have chosen to serve this force, instead of standing with the ranks of the Light, and you will find that my Master is powerful, honorable, and merciful. It just... doesn't quite look as you might expect, coming from the Light."

If you are radiant, said the TwiiLii, then there is nothing to fear of the Shadow Walkers, for your radiance will cast them away. But, they are cunning, and patient, it is the losing of your radiance which you must be watchful of, even for a moment, for the seeds of their bitter vines will take root in the soul most quickly, and take immense effort in this age to uproot.
