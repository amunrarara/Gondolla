Throughout the galaxy, there travels a wandering tribe. The Twii Lii, they call themselves, and they are the followers of great Silína. Their origin is within the region known as Broken Moon, whence Silína's body first was formed, luminious and powerful, then broken, forming the matter which other Beings would use to form the first stars. 

That, at least, is the myth which they profess.

What is known to all those who come into contact with the Twii Lii, is their ways are mysterious, their appearance unmistakable, and their ways of travel strange, but hauntingly beautiful.

The Twii Lii travel to worlds which hold, to them, a mystic significance that may bring them closer to their beloved Mother, Silína. Every world in Gondölla carries her essence still, they believe, and wherever shadows still touch, they will descend. Thus, they cannot and will not be found in the realm of the Sun Beings, upon their fiery worlds, and unto the planets of colored air they have no purpose, but the Adánic worlds and solid-matter moons are revered by them. 

Across Gondölla, Adáni tell tales of the Twii Lii, casting them oft as child-snatchers, or ghosts glowing bright in the deep moonless nights. The grains of truth are polluted by fear, but truth there is none the less; the Twii Lii call to the Adáni in the nights, for once every Twii Lii *was* an Adáni who was welcomed onto a Twii Lii's vessel made of moondust, then taken across the stars by the Twii Lii to the Broken Moon at the dark borders of Gondölla, and there would be transformed into tall, fair, dark-eyed beings, clothed in silversilk, and tasked with the mission of crafting a vessel of their own, in order to travel the galaxy and deepen their connection with the mighty Moon Spirit, Silïna.

Unto such tales, the Wayfarers tell many more.
