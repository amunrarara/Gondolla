[[The Academy]]
The structure of schooling at the Academy was of a particular interesting nature. The whole of curriculum pertained to the full knowledge of computers, through from hardware to software. The school was divided among lines.

To one part dwelt the manufacturing arm which dealt with the creation of boards and parts assembled into working machines. There was a great deal of smelting and assembly going on in those corridors. And, those students who learned the power of the microscopic universe, its sciences and languages, worked here.

The next region was the interconnectivity between machines, the wires and cables, the routers, switches, and sound-less emitters. And, those students who learned how communication in all forms could be achieved.

Next was the region of software, of programs; those spirits of intent which lived on the machines made in the first realm, and traveled upon the transmission methods of the second.

Together these three arms formed the primary ring of the school. To the next ring were the sciences that rose from these roots. They can be crudely called, Memory (or the Archive, Archa), Control (Robotics / Anima, Maya), and Sensors (Entima).

Finally, in the farthest ring lay the highest natures available to the craft. These are: Intelligent Machines, Simulation, Calculation,
