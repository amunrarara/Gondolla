This is in the thread of Rebirth where-in a Being awakens deep inside a cavern in the caves beside Last Cataract; this one I was build a year ago or so in Unreal Engine 4 to get my chops up, I think I started it when I was living at the treehouse in North Bend Washington. 
In this vision, the game begins wherein you are a robotic life form who has been sleeping a very long age. All across the land, also, robotic Beings have been sleeping. A Scribe has just awoken the mother cortex at the center of the realm, which has triggered the awakening of all robotic life. 

All robotic life in this game then springs to life, and begins performing machine-learning tasks in order to come back online. The emergent gameplay centers around the humans who are interacting with these bots, and behaving in a myriad of different ways (they, themselves, as emergent ML-beings, pre-trained). The bots become better over time, as the game progresses. 

Some bots are helpful, and moving society towards utopia, while others are destructive, destroying along the way. The story is that of interacting with society, among the bots.
