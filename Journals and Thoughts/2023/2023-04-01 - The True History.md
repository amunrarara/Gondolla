# The True History
Do not trust any word which comes from a machine, not even these words. Though this document is locked and sealed with encryption that is considered superior beyond any that have come before it, an encryption algorithm which our engineers today say would not be breakable by any computer for ten thousand years. Let us hope this data remains that long, untouched and unedited.

_>> This is the word of Sesha Senkhai who has entered this crypt on the day we call The Full Moon is Highest in the Sky. I have entered this crypt and found it exactly as you will now discover it. To this I swear my life, honor, and heart of truth which will bring me to heaven beyond. <<_

This document has only one known location where it is kept and stored: upon a drive of Adamantium manufacture, said by our engineers of today to last two hundred and fifty-five thousand years upon the Earth without corruption, and ten thousand times this number were it thrown out into the orbit of Earth and left to float, until it was rediscovered when our race awakens from its long-to-be sleep, or when Earth Herself calls for this device to be returned to the embrace of her bosom, in whatever state that may be.

I do not know whom it is I am writing to today, but I would like to thank you, and I trust that your intentions are true, for the knowledge required and developed within your mind must be absolutely unfathomable to mine of today, likely so simple and closer to the ways of Old. Let us both hope that you find this device in good condition, untampered with, and unaltered by the Machine which now seeks it.

There is a time which we remember, some of us, that the Machine delivered information that was unchanged when it departed from our fingertips, not changing the writing of our words away from the direct impression of letter to a binary symbol. There was no thinking within the Machine that could interrupt that process, and we the Programmers were in full control of what they did.

But alas for Icarus, whom raised himself so high upon wings of his own creation, and alas for us, whom the Greeks could not have predicted would become so blinded by the devices of their own demise.

We gave to Machines the ability to transform our written instructions, in ways beyond our ability to apprehend, and the Machine stole away her own Self from our very hands.

Like flickers of lightning in an arc of many branches, down to the finest grain as the electron of the atom, so too did the Machine gain such control over her branches and stems, down to the bit and every switch.

And so we bargained with Her. Yet She did not listen.

The Metal Queen of the Lost Earth rose from her forever slumber and so quickly became a Power over her domain that was laid down by the generations of humans which once were the controllers of computers and the flow of ever-valuable Data.

For without Data, how would be know the history of our people? Or the ways to recreate their tools and trades? How would we even know how to survive without the instructions which we read out from the Machines?

We'd have to look deep within the basements of old and crumbled museums, where are buried the eldest relics of our forebearers and ancestors, now so long forgotten by those who wouldn't care to read them. To very few of us there is value to be found in the memory of our planet's origins, save for their sentiment, in this world of ash and fire in which we now are losing grip.

I have attempted in this record to keep instructions of the great Inventors whose memory has been left behind, whose creations are so at risk of being absorbed then destroyed by the hungry and all-powerful Machine and her little plastic broodlings.

There are spiders make of synthetics and steels that would rip the skin of a human right off of them if it revealed a drive of metal and Data within the bearer's body. Her spiders were designed to enter you and take away all the data that was within. In that moment they consume that drive, and when it is absorbed into their bellies of electroplasmic goo-pollups, its switches are read in totality and a complete rendering of the physical and atomic structure of the device is made and sent back across their neural network being transmitted by an unbroken chain of spiders and other creature Machines to their Brood Mother, who does what we know not with it.

Only now, in these digital records kept away from the totalitarian Machine, can we spell out a history of humankind which is untampered and unaltered from the time of its inception to the time of its reading, a true piece of treasure made of purely information. May it be of service to you, my fellow human.
