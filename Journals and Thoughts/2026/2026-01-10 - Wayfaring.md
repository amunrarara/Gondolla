Wayfaring is a frightening thing to witness for the uninitiated. The Wayfarer rests in a position that allows them stillness for as long as months, years, or unto their own deaths.

In fact, death by their meditative practice is the final goal... that is, death through successfully reaching the Heart of the Galaxy; death along the way prolongs they Wayfarer's "journey home" until, in a later birth, they will find their Way bbak to the Wayfaring Ways, and find again the Ways Between Worlds. Thought frightening to witness an Adani waste away in endless self-induced stillness, the Wayferers themselves are off in a long adventure through ever-shifting routes through vast distances of the Galaxy, traversing landscapes of pure, right thought-essence within which they maintain a vessel to travel to points in endless void where a shortcut or powerful ally may be met, until finally mastering the path and reaching that far-off mount, and at that moment, be consumed by that light and return, at least for a time, to the Homeland, Aeia, The Realm of Eternal Light.

But alas for the families and friends of a Wayfarer...

So a Wayfarer said, from their mount in the Heart of the Galaxy,

"Adani, awake, in the edges of Dongolla? This late in the dark side of the Aeon? These cloners, 'Masters of Biology'? A mess they now have made with their lives for sleeping so long... In the voids, so seep in the dark of time, when Spirit has all been sucked up and taken to Miraj to be changed into shadow. Soon they will too, just as their ancestors did when they lit their worlds on fire."

"Power vacuum, they called it," said a Wayfarer whose Spirit had dwelt among Adani for many years. "a concept that appeared throughout their cultures on many worlds. Drove them insane, such targets for Mirori they put on their backs. Whole worlds lost in early twilight, their love of metals and matter made them haughty and afraid to lose their lives to time, as all must do. The Mirori found their anger points, inflamed them, then harvested the lots of their souls by the planet-full. Only the few that escaped the lighting of their dreadful fireworks could make the evolutionary leap to seeing spirit roads again, and let hold of their fears for letting go od born life release. Thus, some Adani are among us here, but also too few."

"Then out from the halls of Miro have come their Spirits?" asked a young Wayfarer, entering their Second Aeon.

"Verily, though not quite; Adani solved riddles of matter unbreakable to all across Gondolla. Into 'True Gold' they shielded their Spirits from the winds of change, binding that astral crystal, fixed in place, unto the form of lesser minerals that assemble to the materials needed to resurrect that form of life from statis would rest in a vat of brine made from its soup. The True Gold coin that was crafted by their prists of that Art holding their true, dissovled material essences, and, y their most cunning crafts, bound their Spirits to that coin of gold, as well. Not rightly developed in pace with the Aeon, left behind in the shifting nature of Time, where Entropy awaits, hungrily..."
