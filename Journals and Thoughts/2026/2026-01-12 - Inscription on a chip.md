"To my beautiful, powerful daughter," the words written on the chip spelled out, 

"Too long will it be between years in which we've seen each scarcely, when read these messages will be by your bright young eyes. I will be old, then, very old, and not much left in my candle of heart to burn brightly, as once it did when I lived in your years. But upon this inscription, bound and spelled out in the realm of [[maitáneia]] where eyes cannot see but lightning can draw, I give you my blessings on all that you do, for your life will be rich, and it will be merry, and it will have bliss, among all the peaks after all the bitter climbs when limb from limb is sore from the journey.  It's exciting, and daring, to be Adani. To talk to another being with long breaths, learn of another's mind and spirit, warm the nights with laughter and live the days with mirth. I bless your many days, to see the many sights that your Record in Spirit will keep for enjoyment eternal. Remember every breath, cherish every thing. I love you my daughter, my northern star."

Only a scribe would be capable of reading the message, so buried in [[maitáneia]] and inaccessible to the uninitiated or uninterested, thus it was either a message stored in-chip by a scribe addressed to his daughter who is also a scribe, or the writer had no intention of his daughter actually reading the message, perhaps holding it as an in-sentiment gesture, or spell. Perhaps another scribe was instructed to carry the message on to the daughter. 

Such inscriptions of a personal nature are quite common in scribal record; four-hundred years of the programmer's art in [[Ajeiajeia]] saw layer upon layer grafted unto the last; first chips were like tiles of mosaic communication, passing messages and signals between braids of thin copper7

"I am a man of Daniál" said the stout-hearted man, "His golden spear rises beside me, even now, ready to cut down my enemies."

"I don't believe you're thinking of the true Daniál, I am sorry to say," scoffed the wanderer. "His spear is not meant to be used in war, but in pulling down light from on high."

"And what does that light do? It shatters the shadows."

"Wayfaring just isn't practical for the star-faring citizen," said Dunu. "If I cannot bring my fortune with me, why would I relocate to another planet? And the threat of Spirit stealers in the dark between suns, or the horrors on the paths through the darks of dark Ways. No, thank you. Lock my Spirit for 700 years on a spit of truegold and shoot me across the Galaxy in a vessel made of earth? Sign me up, just don't forget my fortunes."
