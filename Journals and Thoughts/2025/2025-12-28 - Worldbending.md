Concept: in a narrative, written videogame or otherwise, have tuneable elements that weave through a story, changeable by the experiencer. I, for example, had a silly, somewhat vulgar bit of humor that I'd like to add into my videogame, but I don't want that typically in the main game narrative, just for my character, just at that time. Switch on world-bending and get that feature in there for a time.
