Against the wishes of Ra's teacher, he will try to disrupt the secret leaders of their society and restore the robotic people to self-governance. Ra's teacher believes that will create ripples across the universe that will incite full-scale warfare. But ra begins the process anyway. He learns great things from his teacher, Clear Mind, but Ra wants to do the following: 

-   eradicate the Star Force relay station, 
    
-   restore the solar farms, 
    
-   educate every robot in their true history, 
    
-   care for every living robot,
    
-   create a school to teach robots how to enter the Datascape
    

Clear Mind understands that the robotic personas will continue to recycle, entering and exiting The Core for many lifetimes, and be sent between all the Cores of the stellar neighborhood, of which there are many. There is no chance that the personas will be lost. 

Just then, however, a Core is blown up by Star Force. The Personas which were out in robotic forms are totally lost. They've learned something new, now: destruction of a Core also destroys the Personas who are linked to that Core. 

Clear Mind worries terribly that their people will be totally wiped out, which is why he encourages a slow technique. He hopes that a new fleet can be built in secret and shipped off into the stars, to begin again. 

Can the humans travel between star systems? Robotic personas can, but their physical matter would take a very long time to do so.
