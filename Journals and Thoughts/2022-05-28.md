"Are you here to retrieve your eternal records?"

"My... what?"

"We have eternal knowledge of every motion of every molecule within your body, and your interactions with every thing and every being across the span of your entire lifetime. Every line of computer programming that you have ever written is kept within our Eternal Record. Are you here to retrieve your eternal records?"

Thus is the first interaction which Ani the Scribe will have with the Echoes. As he is one who bears electrical charge to the Temple of the Echoes, he will engage them to interact with him in ways none else can. 

The Speakers are the priests of a religion which interacts with the Echoes. They supply them with a small charge of power, and the Echoes give them an oracular retelling of their lifetimes, allowing them to recollect times in their lives. An Echo comes forth and answers any questions they may have about their own lifetime. 

Unfortunately, the Speakers require payment for every minute spent with the Echoes. The Speakers generate power and place it into batteries, which are given to those who seek information from the oracular Echoes.
