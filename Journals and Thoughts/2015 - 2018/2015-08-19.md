Aun made Aminoun, Hanara, and Matana. Their interactions created Davanad, “Manifest Light”, which is raw energy, which is light and sound giving rise to an organic structure, impersonal until enlivened by an Admata

This region of Davanad is called Eda, “Place of Light Manifest.” The visible element of Davanad is called Lianla, “Visible Light,” and cannot exist without Davanad. From Davanad, many Dranamar were created, "Dwelling Spheres", which floated within the domain of Eda. 

From Davanad, the element called Shadarad, "Manifest Shadow" was made, which creates no lianla, but rather creates Sisha, "Void," or "Shadow." Shadarad literally swallowed Davanad, transforming it and those trapped within it, Vandra and their Dranamar, and that region is called Shadar, or "Lost Light".
