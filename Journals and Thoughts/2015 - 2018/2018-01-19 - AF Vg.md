I'll have to dive into some technical details now. I have some of the gameplay figured out and some is still in the works. Farming is a must, as is land acquisition. Boating and fishing are a must. I don't believe I want to use an inventory system. Maybe a "holding in your hand" system, or something similar, something like an inventory system. A UI screen pops up, showing your character. Slots for each part of your body. Slot for a bag. Inside your bag mechanic that may have a bit of physics. **Not slot-based, but physics-based, inventory system.** For now though, I like the UI idea. Tap on a UI that comes on-screen (it seems like that might be immersion-breaking, though. Is there another way?). Carry items, drop items. Long tools are the primary issue to overcome right now.Â
