The easiest way to control a people is to create scarcity. The Civil War gave Star Force Corporation the ability to destroy Vista’s solar farms using the robots who built them. Teams of Avatars would do bombing runs and destroy solar farms throughout the system. Without power to keep alive, the robots would starve, making it easier to make war. The whole war made a mess of Vista. The only city left standing at the end of it was Vista Prime. Though several other city platforms did remain floating, they were repurposed by Vista Prime as holding facilities and warehouses.

There are two very prevalent forms of control in our society. These are religious control and corporate control. They seem opposed. So in this story, we will show a world under total corporate rule. Religious rule will be a non-issue, though I believe in the Data Crash universe we will show some other ways of controlling the robots. Maybe making them indentured servants to humans who want robotic butlers. That can be done to a different robotic race. Heck, the whole of robotic space has been dominated and enslaved, there is certainly room for a lot of different stories. It can show the injustice that occurs when power becomes absolute.
