There's a few "whole new fucking worlds" at work in my mind at the moment, and they reflect my creative process very directly as a matter of fact. I have a pattern that does something like this: once I've outlined a story, I take a sharp pivot and rewrite the story because I don't like some aspects of the story I already have. There are giant grey areas in my story Data Crash and I'm trying to resolve them with a sharp pivot into a new direction.
I can start the story from the perspective of other robotic beings, I can start it with a memory sequence... But now, I've got two new ideas:

1. The humans are alive in a bubble society, or
2. The robots are being studied by humanity

These can be growing centers for AI and Data Beings who are then used in various ways. So there is a parallel to slavery being drawn, as it has been in robotic stories for a long time. What else? There's this whole _corporate structure_ idea I'm playing with the idea of. Instead of humanity being a bastion of scientists on a single space station, instead we could have spread out and created these AI cities for whatever reason...

The theme of the story shifts, then, from _society vs the individual_ to _greed vs. life_. I had this idea a long time, that this is a planet where AIs are grown and developed, under the oversight of a corporate entity that uses these beings for various purposes. Another interesting take on the story.

Why am I so fascinated with the storytelling device of a robotic avatar?

* To draw parallels between the soul-in-a-body, soul-in-the-spirit concept
* To explore the Datascape _as a data being_

Then my character ROM wants to bask in the Datascape itself and have some wild exposition there. This character is thrust into a hierarchical society and transformed within. What must he cast away? Selfishness. Misguided dreams. But that's what's the rub there. To transform things, he must overcome the greed of humanity by first purging it within himself. Being surrounded by people who pursue self-interest, he must find selflessness. How do I frame that in a story? It sounds a lot closer to the mark, now.

**The Moral Imperative of Data Crash** is: to purge himself of greed in all its forms, overcome the illusion of scarcity, and become a vessel of altruism.

This here, however, is not the only necessary transformation that must occur. Society itself must undergo this radical transformation, and the moral imperative of ROM is actually **the Moral Imperative of Society**. 

So **ROM is a character who is representing this society**, its current state, its troubles, and its necessary transformation. He is young, knows very little about what is truly going on, and makes decisions based on his little perspective. He must overcome his own self-centered desire to be free of his limitations in order to purge himself of the Achilles Heel and become the transformed hero that can save this society from self-destruction.

Now I'm beginning to feel a greater spiralling in; these robots have been abandoned on this space station. It does not have to orbit Earth, per se; it can be near any planet, honestly. I envision that they are in orbit around a cloudy blue gas dwarf. For whatever reason, they were left here to their own.
