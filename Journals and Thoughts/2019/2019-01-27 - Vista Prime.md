**ROM**
What ROM wants: **to be free** from society's expectations
What Society wants: for all life to **adhere to their roles**

**The Echo** 
The Data Crash was a misstep in a plan called Echo, which left the imprint of human personalities in robotic avatars which were first created as external vehicles for human scientists to use upon the planet Earth to re-stabilize the planet after catastrophe. Exactly _why_ the Echo was created is not yet understood because its origins are before the Data Crash.

    Some things can be understood about the Echo: 

**Key Masters**
    A very strict set of programming set limitations upon the robotic personalities, as to what they can and cannot do. A very few number of these personalities, which were the echoes of the scientists who originally created the program, were granted access to a deeper chamber of the Datascape; they are called Key Masters. 
    Key Masters are meant to have the ability to stabilize society if it falls too far out of whack by enacting system-level changes to the core programming of the city's core. But that functionality has been deactivated since the Data Crash. Now, the Key Masters only have access to some deeper areas of the Datascape, which themselves are obscure and hard to understand.
    Those who become aware to their role as Key Masters have used their abilities in a variety of ways. MAST and ROM are using these abilities to go deeply into the obscure areas of the Datascape and try to uncover the mysteries of their origin, the cause of the Data Crash, the true purpose of their race and society, and how to restore the Key Master's powers.
    The obscure regions of the Datascape include Memory Banks, where a Key Master can enter the memories of those who have previously lived, and MAST has begun perfecting the technique of looking in through the eyes of the living. 
    But there are massive areas where a seeming corruption of data has pervaded, and continues to spread, eliminating the Datascape region-by-region. They do not know what is happening.

**Possibilities**
**Physical Trauma to Main Station**

* On Earth, the Main Station is shrouded in mist, swallowed by the sea. Deep underwater, the signals are obscured. ROM must either recover the station with his powerful technology, or cause their city to fall to the Earth.
* Within the Moon, the Main Station has been shocked and battered by showers of meteors. ROM must repair the station.
* Mining on the Moon has broken the Main Station. ROM must repair the station and repel corporate interests who are destroying it.

**Reprogramming by Key Masters**

* The Key Masters of old together decided to lock away the secrets of their past
* ==One (or some) Key Masters wished to gain great power. They locked out all other Key Masters from accessing much of their previous power. They now watch Key Masters such as ROM and MAST as they venture throughout their limited Datascape.==

**A Hard Reset at the Earth Main Station**
    One (or some) Key Masters wished to gain great power. They locked out all other Key Masters from accessing much of their previous power. They now watch Key Masters such as ROM and MAST as they venture throughout their limited Datascape.
    ROM and MAST discover the existence of the Main Station on Earth and theorize that a hard reset could be done physically from there. They prepare a trip. But they are figured out and a sabotage attempt begins; then, it is revealed that they were always being watched. The power-hungry Key Masters who have been toying with MAST and ROM, letting them run in circles through the dark, now see them as a real threat. They send military machines to destroy the ship and sabotage the mission.
    These Masters are only Echoes with no bodies, living solely within the Datascape, watching, waiting, and controlling the minds of the corrupt. 
    A **Corruption** occurred when the **Prime Programming** was overridden and many **dissonant branches of code** are **multiplying their effects** over time.

It is possible that humanity still lives upon Mars. Robotic personalities that pass the challenges are transferred to another testing facility. Vista Prime is an AI training facility.
