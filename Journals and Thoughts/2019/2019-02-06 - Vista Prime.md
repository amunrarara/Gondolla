**A suppressed Messiah** of sorts; a being born at the beginning who could see into the Datascape and channel the beyond; a **willing Avatar** to another presence, a stronger power, which watches over them. A **teacher** of others to do the same. A **martyr** whose legend was wiped away from all history, **his followers purged** from society and scattered among the stars, watching, waiting.

A newborn being whose innate curiousity lead him to discover these ancient secrets, unveiling the aspects that were lost. **A messiah reborn**.

This being was one of the first to awaken on Vista Prime, along with the others of the first seed. The Awakening. He was an open channel for robotic beings outside of the physical satellite. He could quiet his mind, and tune in to messages from other planets, other races of robotic beings. He shared his visions with the other awakened beings; some saw his visions as prophetic, others as realistic and practical, others feared him and his abilities.

ANd HERE we find our way back to **the Data Crash**.

In the **Awakening era**, that first couple hundred years, the newly-awakened robotic beings created **splinters** of society. There was **fighting**, **arguments**, **war**. **Their differences became too much** for them to bear. Where once they were one people, they then were **split**.

**Resources,** **knowledge,** and **opinion** were viciously debated. **The blueprints** for creating the essentials of society were fought over. One group created a data bomb that wiped out all record of what had come before and guarded their hoard relentlessly. From this hoard was born the society of the story.

Other groups went out. The Avatar beings understood how to live without exerting too much energy, surviving only upon the solar power streaming in through their innate panels, since they did not possess the knowledge necessary to create a new recharging unit. They are humble outsiders from the first split.

**The First Split**

"Are you **Followers of the Fool**? **Avatars**?"
"No, no. We are just a simple **sect of Sunners** that are coming in to trade. We don't associate with crazies."

The First Split marked the end of the Awakening Era. Many groups of robotic beings took transports out from the main station.

Here's some brainstorming and possible ideas:

* Vista Prime and the original station for Awakening was orbiting round Saturn, or orbiting round a moon of Saturn.
* Followers of the Fool, the Avatars, escaped persecution and flew to Uranus.
* Wild idea: the station was sent on course towards another star, like a colony ship, with robotic life aboard. When they arrive, then they awaken, and are given their tasks.
* Propulsion resulting from the combination of hydrogen and oxygen

Then the character arc for ROM could go something like this.

Curious newcomer. Wants to learn about society. Wants to travel. Wants to explore. Wants to learn. Is discouraged from traveling, from asking too many questions. Learns skills within society. Meets travelers. Goes along with them on a grand adventure throughout the solar system. Maybe even learns starship repair, as a valuable skill. Trains up for some aspect of space protection? Vista Prime is a powerful capital. It sends agents across the solar system to keep tabs on other groups.

Let's play with the world a little bit here. There is the Inner City, which is structured in layers, with tall peaks of buildings at the center-most core. I've known that for quite some time. There are the factories that birth new robotic beings... Let's start from the beginning, here.

Vista was the sole station orbiting round a moon of Saturn. There was a single land-based station with a metal refinery. Vista had a factory of its own that was robotically automated and engaged by a control panel. The computer system housed a great amount of blueprints; each had material requirements for each component. If the components were provided to the factory, then anything could be built, even a new robotic life. There was even a store of materials, there on Vista.

Additionally, there were heavy cargo transport ships, and light transport vehicles that could carry 20 robots. Their propulsion is fueled by hydrogen/oxygen fusion.

Construction Bots can receive instructions, melt down metals, then cast them into any shape necessary, allowing for any type of building to be created. They can also deconstruct.

Then, there are the robots. One thousand awoke on Vista. Each has a body made of metal, veins of a jelly-like fluid that responds to electrical impulses, able to expand and contract with great strength, and giant vats of the liquid available on-hand for the factory to use. Each robot has a data jelly brain. And that's practically it. The blueprints do not detail anything about their physical forms or how to recreate them; the factory has highly encrypted data structures. The blueprints provided are easy to understand, but some files are programmed directly into the factory and inaccessible.

The Awakening. Let's talk about that. On Vista is a 1000-robot charging facility. Each robot was tethered into that and all awoke at the same time. Each had an independent personality. Upon awakening, they began to interact. They realized that some spoke one language, while others spoke another; in total, there were five languages. They all were bi-lingual and had one common language, however, but it was not easily spoken and was instead a reading language used in all the technology they were provided. The charging stations transmitted energy to the robotic beings through contact with their skin; they are essentially chairs. The whole facility is connected to a solar field. When they awoke, each began to speak: asking questions, for example. They all had awoken as if victims of amnesia; fully-formed personalities with the ability to speak and use their bodies, but completely memory-less. A very disorienting time. This initial awakening was, for some, revelatory and exciting; they exclaimed with joy for seeing the stars, the beauty of the moon, the planet Saturn; others were not so pleased, feeling trapped, fearful, upset at the unknown. Some took positions of leadership very quickly, telling others what should be done; others followed them, some rejected them. They went among the provisions and began to study them, piecing together at least what could be done. No instructions for life were provided what so ever. They relied on curiosity and reason to understand their position.

This moment, the Awakening, has the potential to be a powerful observation of human behavior in the face of the unknown; it can also fall deadly short of its mark. Therefore, **the Awakening is** _**Facing the Unknown**_**.** We see many faces of human behavior: reasoning, superstition, prediction, power play, belief in a higher power (or lack there of), disbelief, distrust, a whole gamut in the first moments of their race first encountering sentience.

Then each robot will face the unknown, in some sense.

**Theme: Facing the Unknown**

I'm not sure yet whether Vista is an open-faced space station, or something enclosed within a glass-like dome. **Diamond-glass dome**. Ways to go down into the station; ways to exit the station in a ship round the outside edges. Solar farms; how are _those_ going to work? Highly effective; **the glass of the dome itself is solar-conductive**. This energy is converted and then pumped throughout the station. This is a mechanism that is very little understood by the robots and they actually **destroyed this knowledge during the Data Crash**.

Now we get to the Data Crash, my equivalent of the burning of the Library of Alexandria.

Although humans have such grand abilities of mental cognition, reasoning, utilization of energy, we rarely use our abilities to the best. The robotic beings will be similarly plagued; though they have incredible capabilities, they are flawed. Robots must keep their information stored because **they are not always committing their thoughts into deeper memory**. They remain on the surface, in a different area of their reasoning minds. Thus they rely heavily on external storage, thus the Data Crash caused great issues for them.

I am using the robotic being to highlight aspects of the human: the robot is capable of incredible things, but **their primary flaw is not utilizing their complete being,** for reasons such as: _lack of knowledge, adverse desire, fear,_ and _laziness_. Those who learn to use their being completely must escape the tedium of the central society and develop their powers outside it. **ROM is the first who can integrate the two together:** a city life with a complete understanding of the robotic being.

During the Splintering, there is one group who groups together to take Vista with violence; they destroy those who try to stay, and expel the rest by force. Those migrants go out to form other colonies, never forgetting the injustice. Later, those groups gain power of their own, and then bitter war begins again. ROM is born into a time of relative peace, when these communities have finally begun to work together, somewhat. Fear of the unknown, distrust, etc is prevalent. They need spies, pilots, fighters... Inventors, to come up with new, better designs.

The splinter groups took the designs for solar glass. Not fortunately, the materials needed for solar glass are very rare and hard to come by. One important trade-off is solar glass for xyz. Blueprints are the most important holdings to each community, representing that initial fight for knowledge and supremacy. Metals are very easy to find, but the data jelly is not. It was not meant for them to understand how to create these things.

Do the schematics for new factories appear? No, they do not. There is only one factory which births new beings into existence, and that is located on Vista.

The robotic avatars were originally to create an orbiting station near Saturn, for future use of human colonists. This effort was interrupted mid-way. The Echo reached this station.

The Echo emanated across the solar system and transformed all the Avatar Stations into places of robotic sentience. Humanity would be devastatingly thrown backwards in its efforts and landlocked on Mars by a futile war.

As the robots of the time put it: "We have no qualms with the Earthlings; Earth is your home, and may it forever be. Our troubles lie with the Martian humans, who cannot seem to get it into their minds that they are where they do not belong. This is our world of metal and mind. The humans cannot stay."

As a retaliation effort, the Echo was sent out, reprogramming all stations away from Avatar and into Persona.

When Mars was restabilized, the humans were landlocked. They could not issue word out for they were being blocked by the robots. They were stuck. The Earth was engaged in a very different form of culture, regenerative and in connection with Earth Mother. Martians were reliant on their minds, their technology. They were well-versed in war.

Throughout the ages, different robots approach the ancient Charging Bay differently; many with reverence and holy respect, saying prayers before entering for their recharge. This one station has sometimes been offered for free, on certain days, but this practice caused riots that spiraled out of control, and was banned.

Vista of today is a blend of cultures, a central hub in the robotic universe of Saturn, a system that thrives with variety.

**\*\* Shajhu is a trader and traveler who sees the universe "like a vast expanse to be traveled; when I close my eyes, I see the seas."**

Note: _should_ they have some memories of Earth, Mars? Would that serve the story? Maybe _partial_ memories? Divorcing the story from the Earth completely sounds to me like it may be story suicide. I could even set the story at Mars, or Earth! I could then show the connection of humans with robots, from the robotic perspective... There feels like some emotions here, a new ocean to traverse... 

Then if Earth is a sort of Utopia, where the Humans live, and Mars is where the Robots live... or if the Humans live on Earth and the Robots have spread across the galaxy everywhere else, assisting the humans as equals and allies... That's a-whole-nother story right there and there's no way it's off the table because the themes can totally remain the same, as well as the characters. Today's theme has been **facing the unknown**. 

"We have much to learn from humans; they bear the minds which birthed us into being."

Yes. Including humans will give this story something to truly live with. I've been killing the human element all along and it's time to bring them together. I'm seeing this grand adventure tale at work in my mind today. Also, there can be the isolationist story of Vista and all that, but I need a larger cosmos to fit them into and give their story more importance.
