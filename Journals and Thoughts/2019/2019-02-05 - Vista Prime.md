Lots of rebirth came through this story this week, and some changes are summarized as follows:

- Vista Prime is the chief city in an archipelago of satellite stations
* The robotic race has been active for somewhere near one thousand years, likely less
* When the robots awoke, they were provided with many necessities:
	* A metal refinery on the planet surface
		* Transport vessels of two types: light carriers, and heavy cargo
	* A factory that creates new robotic beings
	* Spare modules of each part to the factory
	* Blueprints detailing the construction of each item they had been given, except the liquid brain
	* A satellite station to live upon
	* Solar energy collectors tethered to the station
* Robots are born in batches, once every so many years, constituting an entire generation.
* ROM is born among a generation which is characterized for heir forward thinking, rejection of older modes of thought, and seeing through lies which have been propagated throughout society, such as scarcity and hierarchy
* There was an Avatar among the first robots who awoke, and that Avatar attempted to teach these robotic beings about their true nature. However, many among them rejected the ideas he set forth, and the Avatar was chased off the station; his followers either ran with him, were executed and recycled, or converted to other modes of thinking; a small sect remained behind to form splintering groups of religious thought
* Society began to spread; some robots traveled out and created their own colonies. These later reconnected with Vista Prime
* Those satellites under the dominion of Vista Prime enact their strict policies of hierarchy and law, controlled by the powerful robotic beings _at the top_
* ROM is characterized by his curiousity and lack of interest in any progress within society's hierarchy. He shares some sentiment with his generation, who are dissuaded by the concept of prestige, and are focused instead on fixing the broken aspects of society
* This generation will solve the scarcity problem, attempt to unify the splintered robotic race with a common pact, weed out the members of society who are exploitative, and begin exploration beyond the bounds previously set
* ROM will be one of the first robots to explore the Datascape and activate the Radiant Field (wireless technology) present within the liquid brain
* ROM will try to teach others but step on toes, and be executed. His execution will only liberate his persona and he will continue to reveal his being. This will spark an immense change in society
* ROM will begin to communicate beyond the bounds of their planetary region, and discover other robotic life throughout the solar system. This will conclude Book One.Â 

What must be established in Act 1:

* Character Intro; strengths and flaws
* Rules of the World
* Routine
* Impetus; motivates movement
* The stakes; what is there to gain? to lose?
* Negotiation: desire is conflicted by obstacles created by a) moral imperative, b) other character's desires
* Dramatic Question is posed: Will ROM achieve his goals?

From Adam Skelter: Throw a conflict at the characters, see how they pursue their objectives, and fuck the act idea

An Act is a Strategy; Act One shows a character's normal life; Act 2 begins when they pursue a new strategy for gaining what they want

Midpoint: believing you are at your objective, when you are as far from it as you could possibly be. Creates a shift in strategy; frantic, coping. What once looked like it would work, fails, and requires you to shift strategy. Spurs on the fall to the low point

Act 1 and 2: setup
Act 3 and 4: payoff

Act 3 is the strategies that tumble you down the hill; the payoff is nothing but bad
