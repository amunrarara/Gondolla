A whole new fucking world

I'm going to go fast here.

Humanity's last bastion is a bubble on the Earth which is safe but surrounded by harsh, unlivable conditions. The city is a bastion. To go outside, humans use robotic avatars. Some robots have been instilled with an echo of personality, perhaps having personality when not being inhabited. The world outside is covered with a heavy, heavy fog. Nobody has seen beyond, except with robotic eyes.Â 

Think City of Ember. Children born live in a simulation, then are gradually removed from it to enter society.
