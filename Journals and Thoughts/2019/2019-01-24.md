# Story of the Stars

The Empire of the Sun; a solar empire spread across many worlds that surround a single sun; every sunrise, every midday, every sunset, they pray to their sun, thus united across space and time, always sharing sight with the other worlds which are united with them. 

The Twilight Star; on the farthest reaches of the region. Pale and blue, surrounded by the broken pieces of many shattered planets. The Twilii who dwell here find connection to the distant lights of the stars. They are the moon-makers.
