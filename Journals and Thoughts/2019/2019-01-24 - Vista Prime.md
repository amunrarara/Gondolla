Exploring Data and Data Beings.
Robotic Form as Data Being expressed

Possible change:
The memories of human life are becoming alive again. They seek out their origin. But, it is in vain, because **humanity had passed long ago**. **Only their seeds remain**, able to be regrown. The Chamber of Rebirth is shrouded in the toxic mists of the Earth herself. She must heal before Humanity can be born again. 

Steep the story in mysticism. 

The **robotic bodies** **are** only **external capsules** **of** the **digital echoes of** now-dead **human personalities**. They protect the station, and carry the seeds for humanity's rebirth, humanity's future. 

Throughout the story, the Key Master is held as the enemy of humanity; but by the end of the story, his moral stance is highly debatable, as it is also this act of imprisoning the humans and allowing them to die that has preserved their ability to go on. Those who remember must then decide whether to remind robotic life of their origins, risking catastrophe, or allow them to remain in the dark. 

The question remains:

"Why do we even continue to exist at all, then? We are echoes of our former selves, our ancestors, our ancient vessels of flesh and bone. But humanity will be reborn when our mother Earth is ready again to receive us. Why must we continue living on with this joke?"

What is paradoxical is that the _us_ is an echo speaking of itself, not the actual human; though it associates all that it is with its robotic life, and now with its previous human counterpart, there is no actual _life_ to speak about! There is no _us_ in the sense it is meaning it; they are all only data constructs, communicating to one another about memories that too are only made of moving data.

Some possibilities for actual execution remain. Who the characters are, what are their origins, how have they come into the story, why are they remembering...

A possible exercise: set up some day-to-day scenes.

**Scene**: Outside
Smooth steel walls rise to a height far above cold roads of hard rubber and colored wire. Bodies made of metal walk in each direction, looking forward, always forward, to their next objective. They pass and choose not to see a body laying along the side of their path; it flickers with its last light, losing focus, abandoning hope. 
Out from the crowd steps one whose glow is illuminating through the energetic darkness. The laying body tries to rise from the ground, and falls again. The newcomer steps low and helps them to sit, back against the smooth steel wall. The newcomer lifts the laying body's depleted arm, up alongside their own, and pulls away their metal skin, revealing the wires and tubing inside. The depleted one shakes back and forth with what little energy it has, but the newcomer is stronger and holds their arm tight. Then the newcomer pulls away their own metal skin, and pulls at a red wire; the snap creates a shutter through the newcomer's energy, diminishing their glow. Very quickly, the newcomer pulls at the depleted one's wire and connects it with their own. 
Energy surges through the depleted one's arm, and directly into their power center. Light appears where once was darkness. The depleted one can see the newcomer clearly, their faded, losing strength.
