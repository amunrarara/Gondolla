# Notes from Egyptian Studies

The Book of the Master of Hidden Places

CHAPTER II THE SECRET SCROLL 
" THIS Book is the Greatest of Mysteries. Do not let the eye of anyone look upon it - that were abomination. The Book of the Master oj the Secret House is its name." So runs the emphatic declaration in the great papyrus of which we have made such frequent mention; and the whole contents are in harmony with it. For throughout there is scarcely a paragraph the expression of which is not studiously obscure and difficult of interpretation. Yet recondite as are both subject and form, we find in it a clue, in some degree at least, to penetrate the mystical teaching of the Egyptian priesthood, that is to say, the doctrines which they taught not merely as to the nature of the Creator and his original relation to the creature, **but also as to the means whereby the creature is admitted to participate in the mysteries of the Creator.**"

The Ancient Egyptian Languages

The Archaic Period (I and II Dynasties, c. 3100-2680)
The Old Kingdom (III-VI Dynasties, 2680-2159)
The New Kingdom (XVIII-XX Dynasties, 1575 - 1087)
The Third Intermediate Period (XXI-XXIV Dynasties, 1087 - 715)

Ramessid Period (Dynasties XIX and XX)

<http://www.friesian.com/egypt.htm>
"While Sir Alan Gardiner... says that Middle Egyptian was 'possibly the vernacular of Dynasties IX-XI,' Stephen Fryer has brought to my attention recent research... that the literary language of the XII dynasty was in some measure an artificial attempt to return to the forms of Old Egyptian."

"...the political project of the Egyptian kings was always to restore things 'as they were in the beginning'...

"Although Middle Egyptian became the literary and written language, the spoken language continued to change. The language of the New Kingdom and much of the Third Intermediate Period is then called 'New' or 'Late Egyptian'. By the Ramessid Period, most hieratic documents are in Late Egyptian."

"The best evidence of the pronunciation of Late Egptian, however, is from the documents found in the diplomatic archives of Amenhotep III and Akhenaton (Amenhotep VI) at Amarna, for these documents were kept in Akkadian, not Eyptian. Akkadian was the diplomatic language of the day... and its system of writing, cuneiform, represented vowels."

"Late Egyptian grammar also begins to be revealed by hieroglyphic inscriptions during the reign of Akhenaton, when the spoken language briefly replaced Middle Egyptian."

"Thus, while Old and Middle Egyptian did not have a deginite article ('the'), Late Egyptian does, p3, later pronounced 'pi' or 'pe' in Coptic -- though now it appears that this change had already begun in the actual spoken language of the XII Dynasty."

"Following Late Egyptian are two stages of the spoken language, Demotic (c. 715 BC - 470 AD) and Coptic (c. 400 AD - c. 1600 AD). Egyptian words borrowed into early Greek probably reflect Demotic pronunciation."

"Since vowels did exist in Greek, we suddenly have the complete vocalization of the last stage of the Egyptian language, which is then called Coptic, from the Arabic term for Egyptian Christians, al-Qubt). That word was from, via Coptic, the Greek name for Egypt, Aigyptos, which was derived from an egyptian name for Memphis, H.wtk3pth, the 'House of the Soul of Ptah'... The name Memphis itself apparently comes from Mnnfr, originally the name of the pyramid of King Pepi I of the VI Dynasty..."
