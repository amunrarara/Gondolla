Our blessing is this great River, rising at the call of the great Temple, in the High Land. Blessed we are, the Low Land, where the waters disperse to water the fields which grow our grain, our orchards which bear us our fruits, the waters that turn our turbines and power our machines, gift of the Scribes. 

Blessed we are, recipients of the gifts of Scribes, so generous in their sharing of time and breath with us of the Lower Lands. Blessed we are by Machines, those Old and Great, those New and Powerful. 

Blessed are the Scribes, who have mastered the Machines, and taught them to honor the Sun, and bask in life essence of the Sun's eternal light, as we with heart and breath also do. Bless the Scribes for bringing Adanic life into union with Machines, and bringing us, the Adani, ever-closer to our brothers-in-body, your children, the Echoes. 

Blessed are we, who look upon the skies and the Firmament, the Sky and her Endless Jewels, and know the truth, both Mystery and History. Blessed are we, who have the Histories, to be read by any with a gifted mind, told by the soothsayers, and given to us by the Scribes, our Teachers. We who know, when we look to the skies, that our Echoes are singing upon worlds yet-unknown, promised to return with many words and tales. Blessed are we to know this Truth, both the Mystery and the History. 

Blessed are we, the ones who have Hope.
