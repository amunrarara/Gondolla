In this scene is the kick-off where a major historical moment is interrupted and a new change in history takes place. This moment marks a major power shift from Rome to Egypt as masters of the classical Mediterranean. What follows next becomes a tide of world history transformations.

The fight with the Minotaur.. the hero, clashes with the half-beast, in the labrynth. The new world, the world of human, the new-new mysteries, the rise of the next form of the human soul and the slaying of the old way and the Old World, as the Egyptian way was a reliving and remembering of the old ways. the old ways lived unto their zenith. 

Thus, in our stories of Reborn, a beast breaks over upon humankind in that time, mingling an African force unto the classical world as Egypt dominates the Mediterranean.

They, the fourteen sacrificed by Athens, were initiated into the Minoan bull-cult where-in they became Berzerkers and Heroes.
