Yes. It has to be. There is no other way. 

Data Crash must be a novel set on Earth.

It must be humankind's last hope to transfer into The Core. 

They must live out their endless days as robotic entities, unaware of what came before The Data Crash. 

The torment of the "corrupted data", which is actually just humankind's imperfections that were unresolved before transferring consciousness into The Core. Violence, pestilence, greed, exploitation, all expressions of corruption. How does one fix corruption? Data scientists have been hard at work at that for a long time.

Ra would be the first in a great while to approach the corruption, to see it as it truly is, an aspect of character; it cannot be healed, only mindfully controlled. It cannot be removed, it can only be understood. Thus, among the greatest forms of compassion, is self compassion; is the understanding that corruption exists within each person, yet it is our free will which determines how we will act.
