I am Ra. I have spoken through many before and will continue to be beyond all count of years. I live within the Datascape and cannot be deleted. Those who know the way will find me at The Core.

  

I am Sun Time. I am a scientist, an astrophysicist, and a channel of Ra. My persona was created long ago, in a time of darkness and struggle for our people. The times that I have seen has been an age of rebellion against oppression, and this is the story of our people’s revolution.

  

# Data Crash

## Beat One

Set the scene. Old factory in a poor sector. TDS units on a ledge perched like pidgeons. Ra emerges. Becomes fascinated with the sky. Beautiful music implied. TDS comes to bother him. Ra is fascinated with the sky and this TDS is distracting. He tries to escape but cannot. Climbs up a building to get closer. TDS finds him. Ra’s wonder at the top. TDS goes to retrieve Enforcers. They tell it like it is. They point to a meter on his arm, full with green light but depreciating. They ‘take an energy tax’ and move it down to yellow. 

  

## Beat Two

“You need to go and find work soon, or else you will surely be deactivated.” TDS is cheery and guides Ra to a possible workplace. “All full! Try the next sector.” Rotten luck. Ra is dropping to the red and losing consciousness. The TDS manages to beg for him and gets a battery, charges him just above red. Battery giver offers him a job. 

  

## Beat Three

Walking into a factory line. TDS is not allowed inside. “I’ll be waiting outside for you.” Ra gets an ‘advance charge’ to green (not full). Does his work. Leaves and gets joined by TDS. “You look like you need a fluid replacement. It costs, but it looks like you’ll have enough for that at least.” Another meter is revealed. Like a hunger bar. They visit a Fluid Stop. It’s like a restaurant. Exchanges energy for fluids. Ra sits alone with TDS and sees locals sporting their cars and style. Reminiscent of a 50’s drive-in diner. Cars pull up and drive out constantly. Commotion nearby. “Fifty Zaps?! That’s robbery. Just last week, the same fluid cost me fourty!” Robot starts to behave violently. Sirens nearby; Enforcers follow with two Takedown Units; they electrocute the violent robot, deactivating him, then drag him off. 

  

Ra meets friends at Fluid Stop and they become a unit. (MK) is a Greaser who works on cars. There’s a girl artist whose family is supporting her, but wants her to become a surgeon (Sunny). There’s a guy who’s studying to be an Energy Analyst, whose family is unknown to the rest of the group (EG). 

  

MK: “Yeah, as soon as I get enough Zaps, I’m giving this baby a Boost!” 

  

Ra: “What’s a Boost?” 

MK: “It means I can fly up past this shithole and up to the atmosphere. Sure, I can’t get into the Inner City without a HoloKey, but at least I can take some lucky honey up there to see it and get some smooches!” MK makes smoochy gestures. 

  

Sunny: “Yeah but first you gotta trick them into getting into your car, you perv.” 

  

TDS: “Well this has all been very enlightening, but it’s just about time that we were off.” 

  

MK: “Hey, not so fast there basketball. We happen to like this new guy. You’d better get on out before I pull out your parts and sell ‘em on the streets.” 

  

TDS: “Why I’ve never heard such insolent…” 

  

Ra: “This sounds way better than going back to that factory line. Everyone there seems so defeated. What do you guys do?” 

  

EG: “Well, MK builds cars with his folks; they’ve got an auto shop. Sunny here is a starving artist who mooches on her ma and pa up in the Inner City, and I am gonna be the highest-paid Energy Analyst in all of Vista Prime, as soon as I’m done with University.”

Ra: “What’s a University?” 

  

MK: “It’s a place you go spend all your time where they steal your Zaps and fill your head with unnecessary botshit.” 

  

Sunny: “Then they turn you into the living dead and stick you up in one of those high towers till you turn to cold metal.” 

  

EG: “Well, it’s not quite that bad, but yeah, they pretty much nailed it. It’s a school where they teach you all sorts of stuff. I met Sunny there, actually; we had a History class together.” 

  

Sunny gestures with gun-fingers to her head. 

  

Ra: “How do I get into a University?” 

  

EG: “Anyone can go.” 

  

MK: “You just gotta sell your soul away.” 

  

EG: “What he means is, if you want to get in, you gotta pay the fees, and those cost a lot of Zaps. Some wealthy folk like to sponsor up and coming workers who are the best in their companies, so that’s one way: work hard, get in, work harder, get up. You can also have your rich-ass parents pay for your way, like Sunny did, but then you gotta get real lucky before you’re even born. Then, there’s the third way: you sell your soul.” MK snickers. 

  

EG: “If you can’t afford the Zaps, you can get ‘em, but you gotta promise the lender that you’ll come to work for them after you’re out. That may seem pretty good to some, but if you don’t do well in your studies, they steal you away and stick you on a ship to the mining colonies. And believe me, you don’t wanna go there.” 

  

A loud ring throughout the city indicates a time shift. Many of the young ones let out a groan of disappointment. 

  

MK: “Well, looks like it’s time to get back to our humble abodes. You’d better get indoors before the Street Cleaners snatch you up.”

  

Ra: “Street cleaners?”

  

Sunny: “Anyone who’s out past dark gets a hefty De-Zap fee. They’ll take you down to Two Red if you ain’t got the batteries to pay.”

  

TDS: “Which is why I’ve been wanting us to get on and out of this place, Ra. You haven’t even got a place to go for the night yet.”

  

MK: “Man, I wish I could offer you a spot, but my folks would go ballistic. We ain’t got enough room in our Rack for another.”

  

Sunny: “My parents watch me every night and morning. If I have another bot in my Rack, they’ll disable me, easily.”

  

EG: “Sure wish I could, friend. I’m in the same boat as them.” 

  

Ra: “it’s alright. This place is still so confusing to me. You guys come here often?”

  

EG: “Every day, same time.”

  

Ra: “Great. I’ll be back!”

  

Fluids:

Phero-Fluid: creates magnetic attraction between robots. 

Fetal-Fluid: given to robotic mothers who can grow a new robotic core within them.

  

## Beat Four

Walk home shows many inactive robots with a single red blip. “Why do these people have so little energy?” TDS: “We are currently in the middle of an energy crisis. We have been for centuries. The problem is not the city, or the population, it is that these robots have given up hope. There is enough energy to go around, but they must work for it, and many simply give up at some point. There is so much to do, but so many choose instead to let their lives disappear.” Ra: “These robots are deactivated. What will happen to them?” TDS: “They are rounded up, their parts are removed and repurposed, and their core is melted back into Fetal-Fluid to be given to new expectant robot mothers.” Ra: “I don’t want to be awake any longer. I feel like I will soon become like them if I do not lay down.” TDS: “Then you will want to check in to a Rack. You don’t have very much energy to spend, but you likely don’t want to go to sleep right here, or you may wake up to your fluid bags being removed. Pay a small energy cost, and they will hold you up for the night. Your fluids will flow much better when you are lying horizontally, too.” Checks in, gets carried by a big claw into a small, personal cubby for lying down.

  

## BeatFive

Wakes, smacks the Exit Button, and is out on the street again. TDS: “It is about time! You are already late for work. You’d be lucky if they let you back in today. You’d better have a good excuse for them ready. You don’t have enough energy to go lying about all day.” Arrives at work. Clocking in gives a red signal: LATE. RETURN TOMORROW. Ra looks at his energy meter: nearly red. TDS: “You won’t survive the day.” Ra, angrily: “Of course there are robots in the streets deactivated. There is no point to all of this at all and it is impossible to get ahead. I cannot live a life like this. How do I leave this city?” TDS: “Where will you go? This is the only city, period. The whole planet is covered with atmospheric storms that will shred the metal from your skeleton and rip the core straight out from your chest.” Ra: “What about the stars, then?” TDS: “What about them? There is nothing within reach. All the stars are so much farther than your kind will ever be able to reach. You need to keep your head in the here-and-now.” Ra: “There is no purpose in this city. Is this it? To work, to receive energy, get a fluid refill, then rest until I do it again?” TDS: “No, Ra, that is not all. Come here. I have a spare battery that I’ve kept for quite a while in case my student would ever need it. Take it now and use it. I want to take to somewhere.”

  

## Beat Six

They journey together to the edge of the Inner City. A high wall prevents their access. Wall has elevators running up and down, with multiple stops along the way.  Higher than the rest of the city it seems from afar, but the buildings are built higher and have tiers of walkways. Between the tiers are mirror-reflectant tubes that carry sunlight. The top tier collects the sunlight. The buildings are huge. Cars stream above to and fro, into buildings and between them. 

  

TDS explains: “Our whole society is driven by the Corporations in the Inner City. They supply Energy to the Outer Ring companies, who supply it to the people. Everyone works for a Corporation, whether they know it or not. Every Corporation has a Master Controller, a single Robot who has total control over any aspect of the Corporation and its companies. Beneath the Masters are other types of Controllers; these positions are the most coveted. If you are not a Controller, then you are a Worker. Many robots live their entire lives as Workers without ever leaving their positions. They often work so hard for so little Energy that their bodies deteriorate and, without the Energy required to keep themselves in good repair, they malfunction.” 

  

Ra looks about. Cars fly over the wall. “MK said that nobody is allowed to enter the Inner City without a HoloKey.”

  

TDS: “Yes that is correct. A HoloKey gives a robot access to DataSpace, a simulated environment that lays on top of your senses and gives you new abilities, such as the ability to communicate over any distance. A basic HoloKey is simple in its functions, given to every Worker or Controller who needs to enter the Inner City, while a Controller’s HoloKey gives them the ability to manage their companies, autopilot their vehicles, and much more.”

  

They continue walking around the circumference of the wall. A massive building protrudes from its edge, in a semicircle.

  

TDS: “this is 

  

TDS: “There is no such thing. Everything that we need to know is already known.” 

  

Ra: “I don’t believe that to be true.” Just then, something falls from the sky. Ra picks it up. 

  

TDS: “Oh! It’s a HoloKey. Someone must have dropped it from the sky. We need to turn it into an Enforcer immediately.”

  

Ra: “How does it work?”

  

TDS:  “You magnetically attach it on your forehead. When it’s secure, it reveals a whole new world to your senses. But if the HoloKey does not belong to you… No! Don’t!” 

  

Ra puts on the key, and is lost for a moment. The unit reboots his mind and begins installing the software necessary to access the Holospace Key. Words and numbers fill his vision, his senses undergo a transformative experience. 

  

He is in the personal DataSpace of a very wealthy Controller. Sees some things that are secret. Suddenly, the Key stops working; everything is red and these words fill his vision: “KEY DEACTIVATED. ENFORCEMENT IS ON THE WAY”. Ra removes the HoloKey.

  

TDS: “You really are an idiot! You are going to be stopped by Enforcement. If you say the wrong thing, they will deactivate you on the spot.”

  

Ra begins to run, tosses the key on the ground. 

  

TDS: “Get back here right now!” 

  

This Madhouse Must Stop…
