# Characters and more

I've completed a character analysis for four individuals who may be a part of the story. I want to continue now and add more characters. I need some villains, some adversarial individuals.

Also, it will be important, once these characters are created and brought into the story, to be mindful of the effects of contextual story world on their psyches. **They live a robotic life within a strict hierarchy on a space station above the Earth where scarcity is a daily-prevalent struggle**.
