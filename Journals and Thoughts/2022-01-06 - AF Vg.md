I had a vision of Ancient Future yesterday. I saw some sort of future tech shaped like a ziggaurat. The ziggauraut, pyramid, temple, it produces water, electricity, performs chemical fission and fusion, and a whole host of other science things. It's a mammoth. And, it is the life by which the people of the desert now live. 

The people of the desert dwell beside the Ziggauraut, which itself is set in a valley oasis, watered by its produce. A great river winds down and out from the valley, all the way down until it disappears into dust. The whole of the society dwells beside this monolith. And the monolith itself is active, alive, and can be interacted with.

The keepers of the ziggaurat hold what secrets have been determined about it, but the whole of it is still filled with many mysteries. 

The secrets it has given to the valley have allowed life to continue on. Those who know how to use these secrets are given many titles of great honor. They are the Engineers, and the Scribes.

Go to them, and learn their secrets, and be forever changed. 

They will send you on missions out into the desert, to find the great data lines that still run, far below the sand, by which another world can be contacted, and a history can be read.
