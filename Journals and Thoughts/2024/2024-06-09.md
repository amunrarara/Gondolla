There is a beautiful occurrence in the very oldest record I have currently typed out from my old writing: [[2015-08-18 - Creation Myth]]. I feel in these a new approach to the mythology that lifts my spirits. That Shaddah was not made with some sinister idea in it, but that it was a genuine expression of beauty, a thing of great reverence for all The Realm of Light. That each Being took part in pouring a part of their potency into the great vessel of Shaddah, and unto it, beautiful things emerged. That any sort of break from their vision would occur later. That in the void places do not appear primary evil, perhaps.
