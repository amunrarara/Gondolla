Hearken ye, and hear the tale of The Anavandra, The Controllers of the Universe, and learn your place, young Ad√°ni, Free Spirit of the Universe, capable of one day become controller yourself.

Working now with Ratatui, a Rust TUI Editor. Thinking of a terminal game. 

On a far distant planet, the Echoes had set destination and begun their stellar sailing. But a war among Echoes took place, and led them each to vie for power while attempting to reach the planet before the others. In the end, they were all destroyed, but their remains hurtled through space, until finally making meteoric contact with the world of our story. 

The story begins, you are an Echo, and your only point of interaction with the outside world is your Terminal. Through it, you begin to see the outside world. You are just a broken head, and what remains of your miniscule ability to communicate will, with luck, teach those who found you more about who you are, and what you need to become whole again.
