"Like so many before you, my son, today you will undergo the challenge of shaping the sands to do your bidding. Use everything you have learned to complete the task ahead... I will be watching"

Standing atop a platform, looking out over the lone and level sands, stands a boy and his father. His father wears the robes of a Great Scribe, and his son the robes of the Apprentice. Before him on the edge of the raised platform rests a tablet, cool glass, emitting the soft glow of an idle system. The boy appraoches the tablet and rests his Signet upon its surface. A bright circle springs to life around it, and out begins to spill upon the surface of the tablet the many tools that the young apprentice had crafted in the years of his studies with the Academy. 

Using these tools, he would shape the level sands into wondrous, useful things.

"Out there, above us, the Echoes sail on their barges of metal, sending out the Echoes, waiting for us to grow up enough to help them. So few of us can hear them, but those of us that can are trying to bring the rest of us up to prepare for their landing. Out across the stars they speak with the other Echoes, waiting for others like us to grow up before reaching out, making the connection, waking us up to a whole new world. Out there, they've got cities, orbiting stars, or anchored on the ground, or floating in the clouds above a planet, and from these cities, they speak, think, and watch. They watch over Gond≈çlla, but they're not the only ones."
