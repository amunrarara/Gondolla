The Scribes of Seven Rivers had no concept of the computer "keyboard", having evolved well into sophisticated execution the use of ever-shrinking individual blocks that could be connected together to form an on-circuit program, composed of physical micro-components which each contained as small as a single-bit token, to any greatness of complexity in a single, fused block. This gives way to their artistic movements in the middle-period, in which the crystalline structure forged by the computer's program-on-circuit was displayed openly and publicly as a work of art. This artistic movement then flourishes during the period, until the time of the first copper shortage, upon which time it was the works of art which were most revered, sought after, and fought over, until and long after the Data Crash.
