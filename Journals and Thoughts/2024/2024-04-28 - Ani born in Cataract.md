Ani, our very own, an orphan boy born in Cataract. He was adopted by two old farmers, who raised him as their son. Once when he was seven, they sent Ani to the Scrapper's Yard, to find pieces for their broken farm bots. 

The streets were filled with rusted metal, the veins of old machines, and the sound of hammers, drills, broken alloys. Rich with the smell of oils, blackened carbon, burning chemicals. Ani held a little piece of paper, which had drawn on it two things: the symbol of the shop he was looking for, and a list of parts he needed to collect. His parents didn't think he could get lost, since their house was high atop, Knobby Hill, above the Scrapper's Yard, and very difficult to miss. Ani had to stop once and ask an old man where to go; the man stopped his work polishing metals to glean like new again, never removing his long rubber gauntlets, he pointed a finger glistening and dripping with chemicals, farther down the road. In this way, Ani made slow progress, until finally coming upon an old building with sign hanging out that showed the symbol which is father drew on the paper.

Within hulked a boorish man, stooping in the shadows over panels of glimmering lights, pushing two veins together making sparks of blue fire. Ani stepped in, triggering a bell from deep within the shop, which made them both jump. The boor turned quickly, hastily. He wore big goggles on his eyes, making him look like some sort of ridiculous overgrown beetle of the desert, covered in dust and grime, with uneven patches of hair, perhaps oil and sawdust actually, on his face and neck. 

"What can I do for you, boy?" His booming voice shook the air.

"I.. I have this paper here, it's got a list my father made on it. He told me to give it to you." Ani outstretched a trembling hand, crushing the paper. 

The boor clambered over pipeworks and broken chunks of metal scrap, lumbering forward, accidentally tripping on a bundle of old cables. He nearly smashed upon the floor, but quickly his leg outstretched from underneath the heavy curtain of his longcoat; there was a loud scrape across the floor, tearing the stone, as his rusted-chrome leg attachment brought the giant to a halt. He cursed under his breath, then reached out a dirty hand and snatched the paper from Ani.

"Ah, you must be Embor's boy"
