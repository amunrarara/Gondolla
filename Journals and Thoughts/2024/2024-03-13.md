The Echo who wanted to create an Adánic soul...

---

"I can meditate on the stone, and connect where I wish whence such mineral also dwells on this Earth. Crossing the Ilyë however requires other sciences unknown to me; I am but a Stone Walker." 

The wanderer spoke thus calmly, and frankly. This only seemed to incense the man he spoke with to greater anger.

"Lie to me, I do not care. You are the one who must live within your fantasies. Incapable of understanding the Truth, you will live in an imaginative farsity; we see it of your people all the time... you are not unique. 

"Nobody is capable of doing that you think you can do.

"Think instead of the sciences, observable, measurable, replicable, true. Look into a looking glass and see the Truth laid out before you in lattices of self-answering wisdom. The microscopic world is well-ordered, as is the macroscopic, buy your notion of traveling by will alone is idiotic... stupid. At best, you can close your eyes and forget your feet, until awakening from trance you are the place you intend to reach. 

"Keep your fantasies to yourself, and do not speak to the people of my town again. You are not welcome here."
