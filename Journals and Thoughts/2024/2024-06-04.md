O Selena, my Dearest Sister,
Long have you awaited me, 
When fallen to the darkness
I was lost from the Light. 

O Sacrifice, you have made for me,
In your love, to bring be back to my home,
When all I could ever hope for was finding my way.

O Deceiver, one who crafted this Darkness
In your lies, you told me I could be Lord of the Land
Saying that my objects of mind would be whole and my own
That in this darkened place, where Void reigned I could devise
Creations of my own design, and let the roam free here, to grow as I would please.

But lost, was I, to think that there is greater than sharing in the dance together with all the others,
That in my design there should be nothing of any but my own thoughts,
That in my mind was perfection unmatched if only I could separate my thoughts from the others of my family, 
That in my heart could burn the Flame Eternal if took it I did from the Bosom of All and brought it to this Barren of Naught.

I see now your Light coming towards me, Selena,
I reach out my arm, I touch you,
I bring what life I could steal back from Míro,
Lost in Míraj, this capital in Darkness, 
Where I have been thrall ever since I last saw you.

Little I have left, 
of my Spirit, my Soul,
But in service to breaking this ship of Míro's crafting,
Taking us all so far from our homes, 
I will offer my heart in service to The Light again,
That others may remember what it means to be Alive,
That others may grow from their smallest abode,
That Admáta will shine through the regions of Darkness where we all became trapped and light up this space with unwavering light.

Upon my back, build a bridge back to Aéia, 
May all who have lost their way walk it.
