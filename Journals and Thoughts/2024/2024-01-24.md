Game idea: At the start, you're a young person enrolled in an academy. Ender's Game is a big inspiration here. You learn that your academy time is taking place within a computer simulation. That as you learn about the simulation, you will learn how to control the simulation, and learn how to navigate freely throughout it. You will be armed with the tools necessary to navigate The Datascape. Like a school inside the Matrix, teaching kids how to break out of it. Many of my game ideas can fit in here, episodically. Even my travel-between-the-worlds can be simulated here. A sort of simulation made by The Echoes in order to teach Ad√°ni how to walk between the worlds.
