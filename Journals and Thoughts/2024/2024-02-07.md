"Can you help us by fixing our broken water systems? For months now, we have carried water by hand the long march from the river, beyond the mountains. The journey can take us two days in fair weather, but a week in a sandstorm."

"Alas, I have looked at your technology; it is scribe-locked, a common practice in your region of the world. The Scribes who carried these keys are all but hunted, their empire collapsed, and the Sigils which they each used to lock down your systems are all coveted by The Hunters. Even were I to get my hands upon one, it would require both the eye and thumb of the Scribe to activate, which were also taken by The Hunters. I am sorry to say, there is only one method for rescuing your water supply, and that is to completely replace the technology that is driving it."
