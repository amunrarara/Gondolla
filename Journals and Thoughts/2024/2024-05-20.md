A long time since my last entry... there is much to add to the Record.

### Sigils
Unto the neck of every Royal in the ancient days hung a golden Sigil, emblem of an Eternal Spirit. The Sigil was unique to the person who bore it, and was passed on, upon their death, unto the next incarnation of their Spirit, their next life as Ad√†ni. It is said that the Sigil would guide them back to the world, to continue the Great Work which they were meant to perform, lifetime after lifetime, for the people of The Golden River Valley.

Alas, for it is the material of the Sigils which was most coveted by those who would shatter that Ancient Way. For it was discovered that the materials of which they were crafted was, in the heart of this Sigil, a chemical material known to us as a battery, and upon each side of the outer shell of the Sigil, opposing superconductors. Thus the Sigil was intensely conductivity, and capable of storing a stron electrical charge, in an incredibly efficient way. 

This was deigned a force of intense importance to the River People, who used these Sigils in all manner of ritual and ceremony, forming a cornerstone of their religious and spiritual lives. 

But unto those who invaded, and broke the Ancient Way, these Sigils were of a chief importance to their sciences, inventions, and the transformation of the world-to-come.
