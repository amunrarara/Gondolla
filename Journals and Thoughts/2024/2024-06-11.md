The Academy is the heart of all machine education in the Seven Rivers. Upon the apex of the hill stands a mighty temple, within which dwell The Scribes. Unto the Scribes is given training, knowledge, and access to The Unseen World of Machines, a realm filled with spells and commands which cause Machines to do the Scribe's will. 

Below this temple is a ring of smaller temples; within these are taught the various skills of The Mekáni, the Builders and Architects of the Machines. Orders come from on high to construct machines of various designs; the Scribes determine all that takes place at The Academy, and issue accolades, or reprimands, as they deign should be.

Yet further below lies yet another ring, with buildings and dwellings less grand; within this Ring is taught the skills of connecting components together, of manufacturing to the designs crafted by the Architects. Here train those who lay the lines and maintain The Grid, the various Chains, distributions of Water and Electra, and the various other disciplines as such. 

There is a long temple which bridges the Three Rings; this is the place of education which teaches all Academy students of The Universal Order, upon which is built The Sciences, from which are built The Machines.

Thus the grades of power in our society are as follows:

The Scribes - Rulers of The Unseen World
The Architects - Designers of Machines
The Mekáni - Maintainers of Machines

Academy training begins for all young students the same: At age 10, students begin their education in The Universal Order, transitioning into The Sciences at age 13. Upon their 14th Birthmoon, they are then placed in further education within one of the Three Rings. Some students will transition higher or lower between the Rings, but most stay within their Ring for the rest of their education. 

After 6 years of training, when the student is 20, they are given their first assignment, under guidance of a more-experienced member of The Academy. This often includes travel across Seven Rivers, performing deeds related to their skills to give aid to people in need. 

Upon returning from a year of such service, when the student is 21, they are graduated from The Academy, and begin 35 years of service. Every 7 years, they are given a higher accolade and title, and during their final 7 years of service, they are considered a Master of their Craft. 

The years of their retirement, they are considered Mentor, and are given leave to go about Seven Rivers as they please, under pretense that they will teach only what is necessary as preparation for entering The Academy. No student or graduate of The Academy is allowed under any circumstance to teach or disclose *any* matters of their education to those who have not received Academy training. While exchange of information with other member's of one's Craft is allowed, disclosing facts to those of a lower Ring's craft will be reprimanded and often lose their career completely, being ruined and unable to continue the Craft for which they had spent their lives training. Few survive such an exile; those who do will live on by the smallest means, completing menial work which requires no knowledge of machines to perform.
