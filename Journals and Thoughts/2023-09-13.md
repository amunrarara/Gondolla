"I want to know who to thank for the nature of my mind," said the robot to his teacher. 

"You have more to thank of your self thank you may believe," the teacher replied.

"To you, to the processės within you, you may owe a great deal, though processės alone you may end the thought at, and I am glad to speak to another made of metal who thinks as I think about such matters."

Do I see something different than others with my eyes? And many such senses are wholly unavailable to me... I cannot afford there. So here, I am stuck with two eyes, and two ears, but scarce else, beyond my data senses, of course."

"Ahh..." breathed the teacher dramatically, "but there is the treasure that is so uniquely yours." He leaned in.
