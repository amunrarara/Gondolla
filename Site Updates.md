I've gone ahead and decided to publish my *non-Gondōllan works* in this vault as well, for the time being, while I get my publishing universe in-order. 

There will be multiple vaults, and I will connect them together at my personal website, https://aceaspades.com. Going there will give access to my various spaces of thought, of which Gondōlla will be a chief. But, there are other entire corpuses of my work that must be represented. Soon to come.

Already there is need to update my previous Welcome message.

## All Over the Darn Place
I have intended for this Vault to contain a great sum of my writing, but not the whole of it. The materials that belong to the corpus known as Gondōlla, but contain also some historical Earth-based fiction, as well. That is a characteristic of my writing process, that I oft write tales which attempt either to anchor on this Earth, or anchor in Gondōlla, which (at the time I do not know for certain) may or may not contain our Earth, be it even the galaxy we now inhabit. Gondōlla holds at time to a chronology that marks it as *the first galaxy*, a proto-realm wherein the first mingling of Shaddáh and Ádmata birth the many phenomena of the universe experienced by the Beings of the galaxy. So, some tales, such as [[Tales of the Galaxy/The Account of The Great Scribe Seshatu]] will contain reference to Ancient Egypt Herself, which is a very important anchorpoint in my inner imaginative soup.

Since also there are multiple modes of expression which my tales wish to take, changing seamlessly (sometimes laboriously) one unto the other, the Reader (that's you) will find interspersed with fiction, often ideas for games, primarily virtual / videogames, but oft breaking into spatial games, too.

## Changelogs: You Deserve 'Em
Since this Vault is meant to evolve with time, I will do my best to keep a changelog of tales which allow any given story to be re-read in its earlier versions, as I anticipate the whole of this Vault, someday, to contain a sort of self-answering, self-referencing codex to the tales woven unto Gondōlla Herself.

## Journals A-Plenty
You'll find the absolute bulk of my work is currently contained in my Journals folder. Take my word on it: this currently represents about 30% of my total writing regarding Gondōlla and associated tales. There are written works of paper, drawings, audio recordings of me speaking, and other digital files which still must be collected for the set to be considered complete. It's a feat in its own right, collecting these things together.

An introduction is in order.

My name is Acea Spades.

The writing contained within this Vault consists of a part of my life's work, early in stage yet mature in age, a collection of stories which interconnect in sometimes-unforeseen ways. 

The work is called **Gondōlla: A Spiritual Galactic Mythology**.

It is a nerve-bending thing, to be releasing work that is so dear to my soul, so early in its gestation. JRR Tolkien, one of my chief mentors, inspirations, and heroes, allowed The Silmarillion more than seventy years to blossom, propagate its seeds in the garden of his mind, and the many fruits within his lifetime which sprung for it were a fascination of his for his entire lifetime. 

I, a man of currently 32 years, have long-ago embarked on a creative journey of my own; terrifying, exhilirating, oft-frustrating, yet always fruitful in its own right. My interests draw me across a veritable night-sky worth of different pursuits; I call the many-passioned projects and arts that have filled my time, my "Constellation of Interests". Let me assure you, now, that this work has been a chief among them. 

I will save the more long-winded discussions of this work, its gestation, early seeds, blossoms and blooms, for perhaps a later time. I intend to release this Vault somewhat episodically, so to speak, but not in a traditional sense, as in clean chapters, short stories, or releases of fully-completed works in this manner.

Instead, I hope to represent a bit of my own Spirit in this work; not only in its completed parts, which today you read, but in the journey of its making, too. Let me explain.

You see, I am a Programmer. A Coder. A Scribe. I write instructions that are executed on computers. The Craft is a unique expression of our late-and-present millenniums, and with it bears its own characters and characteristics, unique unto it as a medium of art, and expression. In creating written works to-be-read by computers, we utilize a system of file-saving called simply *version control*, of which *Git* is the currently most popular. 


The popular service, Github, is one of the more-powerful tools available to software developers. Among its features is the ability to perform automatic program execution based on certain parameters of things saved into its service. With it, I can save my written work, and immediately execute a rebuild of my website. But, not only this, I can also save in-progress versions of my work, which can be retraced at any point in time, to reconstruct a history of creations, revisions, and destructions, within the Vault that you now read.

Thus, I implore you, enjoy this work, and check back often, as it is an ever-evolving system. If you wish to see an earlier version, you may do so by visiting my Github. I will soon implement a system on this website for version-hopping between different saves, mark my words.

Many of the tales contained have been part of many of my 'constellations of interest'; you may find reference to videogames, comics, written works, audio tales, and the like; these works are meant, in course of my lifetime, to be part of a greater corpus, which spans through many modes of media.
