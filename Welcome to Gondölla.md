An introduction is in order.

My name is Acea Spades. Yes, this is my *true name*, and also my *birth name*. 

The writing contained within this Vault consists of a part of my life's work, early in stage yet mature in age, a collection of stories which interconnect in sometimes-unforeseen ways. 

The work is called **Gond√∂lla: A Spiritual Galactic Mythology**.

It is a nerve-bending thing, to be releasing work that is so dear to my soul, so early in its gestation. JRR Tolkien, one of my chief mentors, inspirations, and heroes, allowed The Silmarillion more than seventy years to blossom, propagate its seeds in the garden of his mind, and the many fruits within his lifetime which sprung for it were a fascination of his for his entire lifetime. 

I, a man of currently 32 years, have long-ago embarked on a creative journey of my own; terrifying, exhilirating, oft-frustrating, yet always fruitful in its own right. My interests draw me across a veritable night-sky worth of different pursuits; I call the many-passioned projects and arts that have filled my time, my "Constellation of Interests". Let me assure you, now, that this work has been a chief among them. 

I will save the more long-winded discussions of this work, its gestation, early seeds, blossoms and blooms, for perhaps a later time. I intend to release this Vault somewhat episodically, so to speak, but not in a traditional sense, as in clean chapters, short stories, or releases of fully-completed works in this manner.

Instead, I hope to represent a bit of my own Spirit in this work; not only in its completed parts, which today you read, but in the journey of its making, too. Let me explain.

You see, I am a Programmer. A Coder. A Scribe. I write instructions that are executed on computers. The Craft is a unique expression of our late-and-present millenniums, and with it bears its own characters and characteristics, unique unto it as a medium of art, and expression. In creating written works to-be-read by computers, we utilize a system of file-saving called simply *version control*, of which *Git* is the currently most popular. 

The popular service, Github, is one of the more-powerful tools available to software developers. Among its features is the ability to perform automatic program execution based on certain parameters of things saved into its service. With it, I can save my written work, and immediately execute a rebuild of my website. But, not only this, I can also save in-progress versions of my work, which can be retraced at any point in time, to reconstruct a history of creations, revisions, and destructions, within the Vault that you now read.

Thus, I implore you, enjoy this work, and check back often, as it is an ever-evolving system. If you wish to see an earlier version, you may do so by visiting my Github. I will soon implement a system on this website for version-hopping between different saves, mark my words.
